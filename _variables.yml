  about: My name is June.  I am a geographer, researcher, and educator who has been living as an uninvited guest on unceded Coast Salish Territory since 2015.  I received a PhD in geography from UBC in 2022 and am now working for the UBC Micrometeorology group.  I study greenhouse gas exchange in wetland ecosystems and associated feedback mechanisms that influence the earth's climate system.  My principal aims this semester are to give you a broad overview to the dynamics governing of weather and climate and to provide you with a supportive learning environment.
