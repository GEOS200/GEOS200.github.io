  about: My name is June.  I am a geographer, researcher, and educator who has been living as an uninvited guest on unceded Coast Salish Territory since 2015.  I received a PhD in geography from UBC in 2022 and am now working for the UBC Micrometeorology group.  I study greenhouse gas exchange in wetland ecosystems and associated feedback mechanisms that influence the earth's climate system.  My principal aims this semester are to give you a broad overview to the dynamics governing of weather and climate and to provide you with a supportive learning environment.

    about: I received a BSc in Environmental Science from the University of British Columbia in 2022. My undergraduate thesis research investigated the impacts of fire on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes (CO2, CH4, and N2O) within different burned zones of a bog. The methodology incorporated chamber measurements and gas chromatography for the analysis. Currently, as a second-year MSc student, I am examining the impacts of seedling removal — a post-fire management practice — on the GHG fluxes (CO2 and CH4) within the 2016 burned zone of the Burns Bog, Delta, BC. This research utilizes a smart chamber with a portable analyzer. Additionally, I am interested in quantifying the net carbon exchange at the ecosystem scale using eddy covariance techniques and understanding carbon dynamics across varying ecosystem types.

    about: My name is Tzu-Yi. I am a fourth-year PhD candidate collaborating under the guidance of Dr. Sara Knox in Geography. I am interested in understanding the key processes underlying the carbon cycle between the atmosphere and coastal wetland ecosystem. Moreover, I am dedicated to quantifying how greenhouse gas fluxes in coastal wetlands contribute to regional and global carbon cycles. Currently, my research has been conducted in both the Delta and Richmond regions of British Columbia, measuring continuous carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchanges in tidal marshes. I'm delighted to be a part of this exciting course as one of the TAs in GEOS200. Learning is a collaborative journey, and I'm glad to support you every step of the way.

    about: My name is Megan and I am in my final year of Geographical Science at UBC. I have been working this past year on co-op with Environment and Climate Change Canada and am excited to be back in the classroom! My main areas of study are GIS, Geomorphology, and Urban Meteorology. Some of my hobbies include mountain biking, climbing, and swimming and I am very fortunate to call BC my home.
