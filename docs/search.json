    "text": "The University of British Columbia and the city of Vancouver are on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples. Specifically the UBC Vancouver campus is on xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) land.\n\nThere are nearly 200 First Nations spread through BC, and many more across the continent.\n\nIt is essential to recognize Indigenous territories and Indigenous sovereignty, especially within the context of geography courses.\nTo learn more about the Indigenous people, culture, and languages where you live and around the world, check out native-land.ca.\n\n\n\n\n\nMap Source\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Do an Acknowledgement?\nA land acknowledgement is meant to convey a deep rooted cultural connection to the land and the historical and present day injustices and violence enacted on Indigenous communities through colonialism. For centuries, settler societies have perpetuated a genocide against Indigenous people across the globe. In many ways this genocide is still ongoing here in British Columbia and across Canada. There has been concerted effort by the government, religious organizations, and educational institutions to erase Indigenous culture and identity which as marginalized these communities in Canadian Society.\n\nAn acknowledgement is one small way to help with that, but it cannot be treated as a formality. It is a time to reflect and build understanding.\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\n\nTraditional and Ancestral Recognize by whom the lands were traditionally used and/or occupied and the cultures have been handed down from generation to generation. The area around UBC was used by many different people, including the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm, əl̓ilwətaɁɬ, and Skwxwú7mesh-ulh Nations.\nThese people are are part of a broader linguistic / cultural group of Coast Salish speaking people. The xʷməθkʷəy̓əm and əl̓ilwətaɁɬ speak dialects of Hul’q’umi’num’ / Halq’eméylem / hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓ and the Skwxwú7mesh-ulh speak Sḵwx̱wú7mesh sníchim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnceded: Refers to land that was not turned over to the government by a treaty or other agreement. Over 95% of the land in BC, and many lands elsewhere in the world were never ceded by treaty. Without treaties, these lands remain the sovereign territory of the First Nations that call them home. Yet at the same time, the lands have been claimed by Canada and these First Nations living on these lands lack a framework to express their sovereignty. This by no means absolves the Canadian government of their crimes where lands were “ceded” by treaty. Treaties were more frequently reached by coercion than negotiation. The RCMP was created specifically to force indigenous people off their lands by any means necessary."

    "text": "History and Scope of the Station\nThe UBC Climatological Station was established in 1957 at UBC Point Grey Campus west of the Agronomy Barn on Agronomy Road. By 1961 the UBC Climatological Station had achieved the necessary standards to be classed as an Ordinary Climatological Station by the Environment Canada Climatological Network (Hare and Thomas, 1979). In the early 1970s, campus development forced its relocation further south, to the Totem Research Station (Figure 2). The station is located 100m a.s.l. with an open exposure to the majority of the climatic elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Location of Totem Climate Station\n\n\n\nStandardization\nAny site of a climatological station must meet basic criteria before its data will be accepted by Environment Canada. For example, the surroundings must be reasonably flat, there should be no major obstacles to airflow, no significant obstruction to the horizon, no extraneous sources of heat, vapor or dust and the surface should consist of short grass. Similarly, the instrumentation must conform to Environment Canada standards. The data gathered from a climatological station are to be related to large-scale air mass and regional characteristics not the microclimate of the site. Insistence on these points assures users of site and instrument standardization so that different stations can be compared within expected limits of accuracy."

    "text": "Climate Variables Measured\nThe station is equipped with an electronic data logger, which makes automatic measurements of climate variables every ten seconds, and half-hour average values are then calculated and stored in the memory of the data-logger. The table below (Table 1) lists the variables measured at the UBC Climatological Station. This is followed by discussion of some specific variables measured at the station and some example data from different time periods.\n\n\nTable 1: Automatic measurements recorded every 10 seconds at the UBC Climatological Station\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInstrument\nLevel\nUnits\n\n\n\n\nShort-wave Radiation\nPyranometer\n1 m height A-frame (incoming and outgoing)\nW m2\n\n\nLong-wave Radiation\nPyrgeometer\n1 m height A-frame (incoming and outgoing)\nW m2\n\n\nAir temperature\nThermistor\n1.3 m height\n°C\n\n\nHumidity\nThin-film capacitive sensor\n1.3 m height\n%\n\n\nSoil temperature\nThermocouples\n10, 20, and 40 cm depths\n°C\n\n\nWind speed / direction\nPropeller anemometer\n10m height\nm s-1\n\n\nSnow depth\nSonic ranging sensor\n1.3 m height\ncm\n\n\nPrecipitation\nTipping bucket rain gauge\n1 m height\nmm\n\n\n\n\n\nRadiation\nFigure 3 (a) shows a pyranometer, which is used to measure the short-wave (SW) radiation at the station. Shortwave radiation is also know as solar radiation, because it is the primary wavelength of radiation emitted from the Sun. The pyranometer contains a small black absorber disk inside a glass dome whose radiative properties allow only radiation with wavelengths (\\(\\mu\\)) between 0.3 and 3 \\(\\mu m\\) to pass through. As radiation reaches the absorber disk, it will warm up and create a temperature difference to the rest of the body of the instrument whose temperature varies only slowly. The difference can be directly related to short-wave receipt.\nFigure 3 (b) shows a pyrgeometer, which is used to measure the thermal radiation, also know as long-wave (LW) radiation. It works in a similar way as a pyranometer, except it measures wavelengths between 4.5 and 100 µm. Figure 3 (c) shows how sets of pyranometers and pyrgeometers, one of each pointing upward toward the sky and downward toward the ground, are used to measure both incoming and outgoing short-wave and long-wave radiation respectively. We’ll take a more in depth look at radiation in lab 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Pyranometer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Pyrgeometer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Typical radiation measurement setup\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Instrumentation used to measure radiation\n\n\n\n\nAir & Soil Temperature\nAir temperature and humidity are measured in a Stevenson screen Figure 4 designed to protect the instruments from liquid water (rain/snow) and shade them from solar radiation, but permit free air circulation.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Stevenson Screen\n\n\nSoil temperatures are measured using Copper/Constantan thermocouples. These are wires made up of two different metals that carry a small electrical signal. The transfer of electricity between the two metals is dependent upon temperature, and from that we can calculate temperature for whatever medium the thermocouple is in contact with.\n\nFigure 5 shows an example of air and soil temperature data collected at Totem field during the 2021 Heatdome.\n\nYou can move your cursor over the traces (lines) to see the values of the different variables.\nThink about how air and soil temperatures compare to one another in this example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Temperature data from Totem Field during the 2021 Heatdome.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecipitation\nRainfall is measured using a tipping bucket Figure 6 (b), which works by funneling precipitation into small seesaw-like counter Figure 6. The depth of new snowfall and the total depth of the snow lying on the ground was historically measured with a meter stick. It is now measured using an automated sonic snow depth sensor Figure 6 (c).\n\nLiquid water equivalent of the snow is typically estimated using a 10:1 ratio\n\n10 mm of snow ≈ 1 mm of rainfall\n\nHowever, this is just an average, and accuracy of this estimate can vary drastically depending on the type of snow.\n\nIn Vancouver, we typically get “wet, heavy snow” which has a much higher liquid water equivalent, with a ratio closer to 5:1. Using the standard 10:1 ratio for a typical Vancouver snowfall would underestimate liquid precipitation.\n“Powder”, the light, fluffy snow common in dry mountainous areas that makes for great skiing has a much lower liquid water equivalent, with a ratio closer to 20:1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Inside a Tipping bucket\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Tipping bucket\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Snow depth sensor\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Instrumentation used to measure precipitation (rain and snow).\n\n\n\nFigure 7 shows an example of precipitation data collected at Totem field during November 2021, when an Atmospheric River caused widespread flooding across the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Precipitation data from Totem Field during the 2021 Atmospheric River event.\n\n\n\n\n\nWind Speed\nWind speed (horizontal) and direction are measured on a prop vane anemometer Figure 8. The sensor is mounted at 10 m above the surface to avoid the effects of local obstacles such as the instrument shelters Figure 1. Figure 9 shows mean annual wind speeds measured at Totem Field.\n\nProp vane anemometers are cheap and function well in most weather conditions, however the mechanical components can degrade over time.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Example of a propeller anemometer *Note this photo is not from Totem Field\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Mean annual wind speed at Totem Station."
