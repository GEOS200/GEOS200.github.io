    "text": "The University of British Columbia and the city of Vancouver are on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples. Specifically the UBC Vancouver campus is on xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) land.\n\nThere are nearly 200 First Nations spread through BC, and many more across the continent.\n\nIt is essential to recognize Indigenous territories and Indigenous sovereignty, especially within the context of geography courses.\nTo learn more about the Indigenous people, culture, and languages where you live and around the world, check out native-land.ca.\n\n\n\n\n\nMap Source\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Do an Acknowledgement?\nA land acknowledgement is meant to convey a deep rooted cultural connection to the land and the historical and present day injustices and violence enacted on Indigenous communities through colonialism. For centuries, settler societies have perpetuated a genocide against Indigenous people across the globe. In many ways this genocide is still ongoing here in British Columbia and across Canada. There has been concerted effort by the government, religious organizations, and educational institutions to erase Indigenous culture and identity which as marginalized these communities in Canadian Society.\n\nAn acknowledgement is one small way to help with that, but it cannot be treated as a formality. It is a time to reflect and build understanding.\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\n\nTraditional and Ancestral Recognize by whom the lands were traditionally used and/or occupied and the cultures have been handed down from generation to generation. The area around UBC was used by many different people, including the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm, əl̓ilwətaɁɬ, and Skwxwú7mesh-ulh Nations.\nThese people are are part of a broader linguistic / cultural group of Coast Salish speaking people. The xʷməθkʷəy̓əm and əl̓ilwətaɁɬ speak dialects of Hul’q’umi’num’ / Halq’eméylem / hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓ and the Skwxwú7mesh-ulh speak Sḵwx̱wú7mesh sníchim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnceded: Refers to land that was not turned over to the government by a treaty or other agreement. Over 95% of the land in BC, and many lands elsewhere in the world were never ceded by treaty. Without treaties, these lands remain the sovereign territory of the First Nations that call them home. Yet at the same time, the lands have been claimed by Canada and these First Nations living on these lands lack a framework to express their sovereignty. This by no means absolves the Canadian government of their crimes where lands were “ceded” by treaty. Treaties were more frequently reached by coercion than negotiation. The RCMP was created specifically to force indigenous people off their lands by any means necessary."

    "text": "History and Scope of the Station\nThe UBC Climatological Station was established in 1957 at UBC Point Grey Campus west of the Agronomy Barn on Agronomy Road. By 1961 the UBC Climatological Station had achieved the necessary standards to be classed as an Ordinary Climatological Station by the Environment Canada Climatological Network (Hare and Thomas, 1979). In the early 1970s, campus development forced its relocation further south, to the Totem Research Station (Figure 2). The station is located 100m a.s.l. with an open exposure to the majority of the climatic elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Location of Totem Climate Station\n\n\n\nStandardization\nAny site of a climatological station must meet basic criteria before its data will be accepted by Environment Canada. For example, the surroundings must be reasonably flat, there should be no major obstacles to airflow, no significant obstruction to the horizon, no extraneous sources of heat, vapor or dust and the surface should consist of short grass. Similarly, the instrumentation must conform to Environment Canada standards. The data gathered from a climatological station are to be related to large-scale air mass and regional characteristics not the microclimate of the site. Insistence on these points assures users of site and instrument standardization so that different stations can be compared within expected limits of accuracy."

Shortwave radiation is also know as solar radiation, because it is the primary wavelength of radiation emitted from the Sun. The pyranometer contains a small black absorber disk inside a glass dome whose radiative properties allow only radiation with wavelengths (\\(\\mu\\)) between 0.3 and 3 \\(\\mu m\\) to pass through. As radiation reaches the absorber disk, it will warm up and create a temperature difference to the rest of the body of the instrument whose temperature varies only slowly. The difference can be directly related to short-wave receipt.\nFigure 3 (b) shows a pyrgeometer, which is used to measure the thermal radiation, also know as long-wave (LW) radiation. It works in a similar way as a pyranometer, except it measures wavelengths between 4.5 and 100 µm. Figure 3 (c) shows how sets of pyranometers and pyrgeometers, one of each pointing upward toward the sky and downward toward the ground, are used to measure both incoming and outgoing short-wave and long-wave radiation respectively. We’ll take a more in depth look at radiation in lab 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Pyranometer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Pyrgeometer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Typical radiation measurement setup\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Instrumentation used to measure radiation\n\n\n\n\nAir & Soil Temperature\nAir temperature and humidity are measured in a Stevenson screen Figure 4 designed to protect the instruments from liquid water (rain/snow) and shade them from solar radiation, but permit free air circulation.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Stevenson Screen\n\n\nSoil temperatures are measured using Copper/Constantan thermocouples. These are wires made up of two different metals that carry a small electrical signal. The transfer of electricity between the two metals is dependent upon temperature, and from that we can calculate temperature for whatever medium the thermocouple is in contact with.\n\nFigure 5 shows an example of air and soil temperature data collected at Totem field during the 2021 Heatdome.\n\nYou can move your cursor over the traces (lines) to see the values of the different variables.\nThink about how air and soil temperatures compare to one another in this example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Temperature data from Totem Field during the 2021 Heatdome.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecipitation\nRainfall is measured using a tipping bucket Figure 6 (b), which works by funneling precipitation into small seesaw-like counter Figure 6. The depth of new snowfall and the total depth of the snow lying on the ground was historically measured with a meter stick. It is now measured using an automated sonic snow depth sensor Figure 6 (c).\n\nLiquid water equivalent of the snow is typically estimated using a 10:1 ratio\n\n10 mm of snow ≈ 1 mm of rainfall\n\nHowever, this is just an average, and accuracy of this estimate can vary drastically depending on the type of snow.\n\nIn Vancouver, we typically get “wet, heavy snow” which has a much higher liquid water equivalent, with a ratio closer to 5:1. Using the standard 10:1 ratio for a typical Vancouver snowfall would underestimate liquid precipitation.\n“Powder”, the light, fluffy snow common in dry mountainous areas that makes for great skiing has a much lower liquid water equivalent, with a ratio closer to 20:1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Inside a Tipping bucket\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Tipping bucket\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Snow depth sensor\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Instrumentation used to measure precipitation (rain and snow).\n\n\n\nFigure 7 shows an example of precipitation data collected at Totem field during November 2021, when an Atmospheric River caused widespread flooding across the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Precipitation data from Totem Field during the 2021 Atmospheric River event.\n\n\n\n\n\nWind Speed\nWind speed (horizontal) and direction are measured on a prop vane anemometer Figure 8.

    "section": "Short-wave & Long-wave Radiation",
    "text": "Short-wave & Long-wave Radiation\nIn meteorology, we broadly classify radiation by wavelength \\(\\lambda\\) as either short-wave (\\(SW\\)) or long-wave (\\(LW\\)). Units of wavelength are often given in micrometers (1 \\(\\mu m\\) = 10-6 m). The distinction is relative and you may see variability across the literature. We will define them as:\n\nShort-wave (\\(SW\\)): \\(\\lambda < 3 \\mu m\\)\nLong-wave (\\(LW\\)): \\(\\lambda >= 3 \\mu m\\)\n\nRecall from lecture1 2 3: radiation may interact with an object in one of three ways; it can be absorbed, transmitted, or reflected.\n\n\n\\[\na_\\lambda + \\tau_\\lambda + \\alpha_\\lambda = 1\n\\tag{1}\\]\n\nThe coefficients of absorption (\\(a_\\lambda\\)), transmission (\\(\\tau_\\lambda\\)), and reflection (\\(\\alpha_\\lambda\\)) vary depending on the wavelength \\(\\lambda\\) of the incident radiation and the properties of the object.\nPlant leaves have interesting radiative properties that are part of the plants’ adaptation to their environments. The coefficients of reflection, transmission and absorption are strongly dependent on wavelength as shown by a typical example in Figure 1.\n\nEnergy is strongly absorbed in the visible region where radiation is active in photosynthesis.\nIn the near infrared region (NIR) radiation is more strongly reflected and transmitted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Spectral absorptivity, reflectivity and transmissivity of a poplar leaf\n\n\n\n\nRecall from lecture1; the radiative output of an object is proportional to its temperature. The total radiative output can be approximated (for an idealized object) using the Stefan-Boltzman law:\n\\[\nE_b = \\sigma_b T^4\n\\tag{2}\\]\n\n\nTo describe a radiation source, we can plot its spectrum. Spectra for solar radiation and radiation from a fluorescent lamp and an incandescent tungsten filament lamp are shown in Figure 2.\n\nBecause the sun is very hot (\\(\\approx\\) 5800 K) it emits a large amount of radiation across a wide range of the wavelengths Figure 3.\n\nIt is important to note that: short-wave radiation makes up the overwhelming majority (99+%) of the sun’s radiative output\n\n\nBecause the earth is relatively cool (\\(\\approx\\) 288 K) it emits a smaller amount of radiation across a narrower range of wavelengths.\n\nIt is important to note that: the earth does not emit short-wave radiation because it is to cool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Observed spectral irradiance of sunlight, a Tungsten incandescent land (2700°C) and a fluorescent lamp. In this diagram, the spectra have been adjusted to equal peak heights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Black-body spectral irradiance of the Sun and Earth (logarithmic scale).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Black-body spectral irradiance of the Sun and Earth.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Idealized (Black-body) spectral irradiance of the Sun and Earth. Calculated using plank’s law see lecture assuming the objects operate as black bodies.\n\n\nFollowing equation Equation 1. A portion of incoming short-wave radiation (\\(SW \\downarrow\\)) that hits Earth is reflected by the surface back towards the sky as outgoing short-wave radiation (\\(SW \\uparrow\\)). We can define the term albedo to describe reflected short wave radiation (\\(\\alpha_SW\\)):\n\\[\nalbedo = \\alpha_{SW} = \\frac{\\uparrow SW}{\\downarrow SW}\n\\tag{3}\\]\nFollowing Equation 1, the earth can also absorb shortwave radiation (\\(a_{SW}\\)). The earth (as a whole) also does not transmit short-wave radiation (\\(\\tau_{SW}\\)). However objects on or near its surface, such as leaves can Figure 1. When dealing with an opaque object such as a the surface of the earth, we can define absorption as Equation 4, but when dealing with transparent objects such as leaves or water, we must define absorption as Equation 5:\n\\[\na_{\\lambda} = 1  - \\alpha_{\\lambda}\n\\tag{4}\\]\n\\[\na_{\\lambda} = 1  - \\alpha_{\\lambda} - \\tau_{\\lambda}\n\\tag{5}\\]\n\nNote Equation 1 and Equation 5 are equivalent to one another.\n\nFollowing Equation 4, any short-wave radiation that is not reelected by the Earth’s surface, will be absorbed. When short-wave radiation is absorbed, the energy is “transformed” from one form to another. Some of the energy goes towards phase changes of water, some of it goes into chemical reactions (e.g., photosynthesis), and a large portion of it is re-emitted as outgoing long-wave radiation (\\(LW\\uparrow\\)), aka. thermal radiation. Following\nCombining these Net All-Wave Radiation (\\(R_n\\)), as defined in Equation 6, is the sum of all incoming (\\(\\downarrow\\)) and outgoing (\\(\\uparrow\\)) short-wave (\\(SW\\)) and long-wave (\\(LW\\)) radiation. Net radiation can tell us how much energy is entering (positive) or leaving (negative) the site at any given time. If net \\((R_n)\\) is a large positive number, that indicates significant energy input, which would cause the land surface at the site to warm up. Conversely, if \\((R_n)\\) is negative, that means the site is loosing energy (cooling off).\n\\[\nR_n = (SW \\downarrow - SW \\uparrow) + (LW \\downarrow - LW \\uparrow)\n\\tag{6}\\]\nThe all-wave budget could also be considered to consist of a net short-wave budget, \\(SW* = SW\\downarrow - SW\\uparrow\\) and a long-wave budget \\(SW* = SW\\downarrow - SW\\uparrow\\) , i.e. \\(R_n = SW* + LW*\\). The sign convention adopted here is that individual fluxes have no sign (i.e., always positive) but net fluxes (those with an asterisk) are positive if they are a net energy gain for the surface, and negative if they are a net energy loss."

My undergraduate thesis research investigated the impacts of fire on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes (CO2, CH4, and N2O) within different burned zones of a bog. The methodology incorporated chamber measurements and gas chromatography for the analysis. Currently, as a second-year MSc student, I am examining the impacts of seedling removal — a post-fire management practice — on the GHG fluxes (CO2 and CH4) within the 2016 burned zone of the Burns Bog, Delta, BC. This research utilizes a smart chamber with a portable analyzer. Additionally, I am interested in quantifying the net carbon exchange at the ecosystem scale using eddy covariance techniques and understanding carbon dynamics across varying ecosystem types."

This system uses a small number of base units from which other derived units can be obtained. The SI base units are listed in Table 1 and should be used whenever applicable in this course.\n\nThe unit for temperature is Kelvin (K, not \\(^{\\circ} K\\)). Temperatures may be also indicated in degree Celsius ( \\(^{\\circ} C\\) ). However, temperature-differences should be referred to as Kelvin (K). The conversion is listed in ?@eq-Kelvin-to-Celsius. Note how one Kelvin is equivalent to one degree Celsius, but the units have different zero points.\n\n0 K represents absolute zero, which is the lowest possible temperature: i.e., a complete lack of energy in a system.\n\nKelvin is on a ratio scale: it starts at a fixed, meaningful zero value and can only take positive values. This allows for relative comparisons between values:\n\ne.ge., 100 K is “twice as hot” as 50 K\n\n\n\\(^{\\circ} C\\) is the freezing point of fresh water at 1 atm (mean atmospheric pressure at sea level).\n\nCelsius is on an interval scale > it has an arbitrary zero value and can take positive or negative values. This prevents relative comparisons between values:\n\ne.ge., 100 \\(^{\\circ} C\\) is not “twice as hot” as 50 \\(^{\\circ} C\\)\n\n\n\nYou can use the following equation to convert between Celsius and Kelvin:\n\n\\[\nT(K) = T(\\deg C) + 273.15\n\\tag{1}\\]\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: SI Base Units.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSI base unit\nSymbol\nQuantity\n\n\n\n\nMeter\nm\nLength\n\n\nKilogram\nKg\nMass\n\n\nSecond\ns\nTime\n\n\nKelvin\nK\nThermodynamic Temperature\n\n\nAmpere\nA\nElectric current\n\n\nMole\nmol\nAmount of a substance\n\n\nCandela\ncd\nLuminous intensity"
