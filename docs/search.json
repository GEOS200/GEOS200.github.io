    "text": "The University of British Columbia and the city of Vancouver are on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples. Specifically the UBC Vancouver campus is on xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) land.\n\nThere are nearly 200 First Nations spread through BC, and many more across the continent.\n\nIt is essential to recognize Indigenous territories and Indigenous sovereignty, especially within the context of geography courses.\nTo learn more about the Indigenous people, culture, and languages where you live and around the world, check out native-land.ca.\n\n\n\n\n\nMap Source\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Do an Acknowledgement?\nA land acknowledgement is meant to convey a deep rooted cultural connection to the land and the historical and present day injustices and violence enacted on Indigenous communities through colonialism. For centuries, settler societies have perpetuated a genocide against Indigenous people across the globe. In many ways this genocide is still ongoing here in British Columbia and across Canada. There has been concerted effort by the government, religious organizations, and educational institutions to erase Indigenous culture and identity which as marginalized these communities in Canadian Society.\n\nAn acknowledgement is one small way to help with that, but it cannot be treated as a formality. It is a time to reflect and build understanding.\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\n\nTraditional and Ancestral Recognize by whom the lands were traditionally used and/or occupied and the cultures have been handed down from generation to generation. The area around UBC was used by many different people, including the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm, əl̓ilwətaɁɬ, and Skwxwú7mesh-ulh Nations.\nThese people are are part of a broader linguistic / cultural group of Coast Salish speaking people. The xʷməθkʷəy̓əm and əl̓ilwətaɁɬ speak dialects of Hul’q’umi’num’ / Halq’eméylem / hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓ and the Skwxwú7mesh-ulh speak Sḵwx̱wú7mesh sníchim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnceded: Refers to land that was not turned over to the government by a treaty or other agreement. Over 95% of the land in BC, and many lands elsewhere in the world were never ceded by treaty. Without treaties, these lands remain the sovereign territory of the First Nations that call them home. Yet at the same time, the lands have been claimed by Canada and these First Nations living on these lands lack a framework to express their sovereignty. This by no means absolves the Canadian government of their crimes where lands were “ceded” by treaty. Treaties were more frequently reached by coercion than negotiation. The RCMP was created specifically to force indigenous people off their lands by any means necessary."

    "text": "History and Scope of the Station\nThe UBC Climatological Station was established in 1957 at UBC Point Grey Campus west of the Agronomy Barn on Agronomy Road. By 1961 the UBC Climatological Station had achieved the necessary standards to be classed as an Ordinary Climatological Station by the Environment Canada Climatological Network (Hare and Thomas, 1979). In the early 1970s, campus development forced its relocation further south, to the Totem Research Station (Figure 2). The station is located 100m a.s.l. with an open exposure to the majority of the climatic elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Location of Totem Climate Station\n\n\n\nStandardization\nAny site of a climatological station must meet basic criteria before its data will be accepted by Environment Canada. For example, the surroundings must be reasonably flat, there should be no major obstacles to airflow, no significant obstruction to the horizon, no extraneous sources of heat, vapor or dust and the surface should consist of short grass. Similarly, the instrumentation must conform to Environment Canada standards. The data gathered from a climatological station are to be related to large-scale air mass and regional characteristics not the microclimate of the site. Insistence on these points assures users of site and instrument standardization so that different stations can be compared within expected limits of accuracy."

The table below (Table 1) lists the variables measured at the UBC Climatological Station. This is followed by discussion of some specific variables measured at the station and some example data from different time periods.\n\n\nTable 1: Automatic measurements recorded every 10 seconds at the UBC Climatological Station\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInstrument\nLevel\nUnits\n\n\n\n\nShort-wave Radiation\nPyranometer\n1 m height A-frame (incoming and outgoing)\nW m2\n\n\nLong-wave Radiation\nPyrgeometer\n1 m height A-frame (incoming and outgoing)\nW m2\n\n\nAir temperature\nThermistor\n1.3 m height\n°C\n\n\nHumidity\nThin-film capacitive sensor\n1.3 m height\n%\n\n\nSoil temperature\nThermocouples\n10, 20, and 40 cm depths\n°C\n\n\nWind speed / direction\nPropeller anemometer\n10m height\nm s-1\n\n\nSnow depth\nSonic ranging sensor\n1.3 m height\ncm\n\n\nPrecipitation\nTipping bucket rain gauge\n1 m height\nmm\n\n\n\n\n\nRadiation\nFigure 3 (a) shows a pyranometer, which is used to measure the short-wave (SW) radiation at the station. Shortwave radiation is also know as solar radiation, because it is the primary wavelength of radiation emitted from the Sun. The pyranometer contains a small black absorber disk inside a glass dome whose radiative properties allow only radiation with wavelengths (\\(\\mu\\)) between 0.3 and 3 \\(\\mu m\\) to pass through. As radiation reaches the absorber disk, it will warm up and create a temperature difference to the rest of the body of the instrument whose temperature varies only slowly. The difference can be directly related to short-wave receipt. Figure 4 shows an example of incoming SW measured at the totem field climate station.\nFigure 3 (b) shows a pyrgeometer, which is used to measure the thermal radiation, also know as long-wave (LW) radiation. It works in a similar way as a pyranometer, except it measures wavelengths between 4.5 and 100 µm. Figure 3 (c) shows how sets of pyranometers and pyrgeometers, one of each pointing upward toward the sky and downward toward the ground, are used to measure both incoming and outgoing short-wave and long-wave radiation respectively. We’ll take a more in depth look at radiation in lab 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Pyranometer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Pyrgeometer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Typical radiation measurement setup\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Instrumentation used to measure radiation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Incoming solar radiation measured at Totem Field during the 2021 Heatdome.\n\n\n\n\n\nAir & Soil Temperature\nAir temperature and humidity are measured in a Stevenson screen Figure 5 designed to protect the instruments from liquid water (rain/snow) and shade them from solar radiation, but permit free air circulation.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Stevenson Screen\n\n\nSoil temperatures are measured using Copper/Constantan thermocouples. These are wires made up of two different metals that carry a small electrical signal. The transfer of electricity between the two metals is dependent upon temperature, and from that we can calculate temperature for whatever medium the thermocouple is in contact with.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Temperature data from Totem Field during the 2021 Heatdome.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecipitation\nRainfall is measured using a tipping bucket Figure 7 (b), which works by funneling precipitation into small seesaw-like counter Figure 7. The depth of new snowfall and the total depth of the snow lying on the ground was historically measured with a meter stick. It is now measured using an automated sonic snow depth sensor Figure 7 (c).\n\nLiquid water equivalent of the snow is typically estimated using a 10:1 ratio\n\n10 mm of snow ≈ 1 mm of rainfall\n\nHowever, this is just an average, and accuracy of this estimate can vary drastically depending on the type of snow.\n\nIn Vancouver, we typically get “wet, heavy snow” which has a much higher liquid water equivalent, with a ratio closer to 5:1. Using the standard 10:1 ratio for a typical Vancouver snowfall would underestimate liquid precipitation.\n“Powder”, the light, fluffy snow common in dry mountainous areas that makes for great skiing has a much lower liquid water equivalent, with a ratio closer to 20:1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Inside a Tipping bucket\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Tipping bucket\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Snow depth sensor\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Instrumentation used to measure precipitation (rain and snow).\n\n\nFigure 7 (b) shows Precipitation data from Totem field during November 2021, when an Atmospheric River caused widespread flooding across the region.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Precipitation data from Totem Field during the 2021 Atmospheric River event.\n\n\n\n\n\nWind Speed\nWind speed (horizontal) and direction are measured on a prop vane anemometer Figure 9 (a).

Climate of an ecosystem is largely determined by the amount of incoming short wave radiation (\\(SW \\downarrow\\)) that reaches the ecosystem and the proportion of that radiation that is absorbed (\\(a\\)) by the plant, soil and water surfaces versus the portion that is reflected (\\(\\alpha\\)) by the surface.\n\nWhen \\(SW \\downarrow\\) that is absorbed by the earth’s surface, it is re-emitted by the surface as long-wave radiation (\\(LW \\uparrow\\)), aka (aka thermal radiation). Figure 1 highlights the difference between short-wave radiation (emitted by the sun) and long-wave radiation (emitted by the earth).\n\nA portion of \\(SW \\downarrow\\) is reflected by the earths surface back towards the sky, this is known as outgoing, or reflected short-wave radiation (\\(SW \\uparrow\\)).\nNet Radiation can describe how much energy is entering or leaving a given area. Incoming short-wave \\((\\downarrow SW)\\) is measured by a pyranometer pointing up to the sky and short-wave radiation outgoing (reflected) from the underlying surface \\((\\uparrow SW)\\) is measured by a pyranometer pointed at the ground. Likewise, incoming long-wave radiation \\((\\downarrow LW)\\) is measured by a pyrgeometer pointing up to the sky and outgoing (emitted) long-wave radiation \\((\\uparrow LW)\\) is measured by a pyrgeometer pointing at the ground. Knowing the four radiation components, we can then calculate net radiation \\((R_n)\\). Net radiation can tell us how much energy is entering (positive) or leaving (negative) the site at any given time. If net \\((R_n)\\) is a large positive number, that indicates significant energy input, which would cause the land surface at the site to warm up. Conversely, if \\((R_n)\\) is negative, that means the site is loosing energy (cooling off).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Simplified comparison of short wave and long wave radiation as they relate to the emissions from the Sun and the Earth.\n\n\nTropical climates are hot because they receive ample \\(SW \\downarrow\\) all year long.

The coefficients of reflection, transmission and absorption are strongly dependent on wavelength as shown by a typical example in Figure 3. Energy is strongly absorbed in the visible region where radiation is active in photosynthesis. In the near infrared region (NIR) radiation is more strongly reflected and transmitted. The reflectivity and absorptivity of soils and animal coats are also dependent on wavelength.\nUnits of wavelength are often given in micrometers (1 \\(\\mu m\\) = 10-6 m). Radiation energy flux density can be measured by sensors that produce electrical signals. In this laboratory the selenium photocell produces a voltage that is proportional to the flux of shortwave radiation striking the sensor. The sensor is not sensitive to longwave radiation.

    "text": "Theory\nThe most common type of instrument used to measure humidity is the psychrometer. This consists simply of a pair of thermometers, one of which has a wetted wick enclosing the sensor. The wet-bulb is cooled by evaporation to a temperature that depends on the atmospheric vapor density.\nThe water vapor density \\(\\rho_v\\) (= absolute humidity) can be calculated from measurements of wet- and dry-bulb temperatures using the relationship:\n\\[\n\\rho_v = \\rho^*_{vw}(T_w) - \\gamma(T-T_w)\n\\tag{1}\\]\nThese and other symbols in this exercise are defined in Table 5.1. The density of water vapor in the atmosphere \\(\\rho_v(T)\\), is the basic measure of atmospheric moisture. It is the mass of water vapor in unit volume of air (Units: kg m-3 but often given in g m-3 to make more sensibly sized numbers).\nOther ways of expressing the amount of moisture are used and each has particular usefulness in certain applications. The total amount of water that the atmosphere can hold without condensation depends only on temperature. This quantity, called the saturation vapor density ^*_v(T), is given for a range of temperatures in Table 2. The ratio of actual vapor density to the maximum possible (i.e. the saturation vapor density) when expressed as a percentage is called the relative humidity:\n\\[\nRH = \\frac{\\rho_v}{\\rho^*_v(T)}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nFor some calculations of evaporation rate, the difference between the maximum and the actual vapor density is useful. This is called the vapor density deficit:\n\\[\nVDD = \\rho^*_v(T) - \\rho_v\n\\tag{3}\\]\nWe may express the water vapor content of air by finding the temperature to which a parcel of air could be cooled at constant atmospheric pressure before condensation commences. This temperature is called the dew point temperature \\(T_d\\). Note: that for a saturated parcel the dewpoint temperature is the temperature of the parcel. For any water vapor density, \\(T_d\\) can be found by using Table 2 in reverse. For example, air with a vapor density of 7.8 g m-3 has a \\(T_d\\) of 7°C.\nWater vapor content of the air can be expressed in terms of the partial pressure exerted by the water vapor, or water vapor pressure, \\(e\\). This is related to vapor density by the gas law as follows:\n\\[\ne = \\rho_v R_v T\n\\tag{4}\\]\nWhere R_v is the gas constant for water vapor (4.62 ×10-4 kPa m3 g-1 K-1) and T is the absolute temperature (K). Using units of g m-3 for \\(\\rho_v(T)\\) results in units of kPa (kilopascals) for \\(e\\).\nSaturation vapor pressure, \\(e*(T)\\): Consider a parcel at temperature \\(T\\). Unless the parcel is currently saturated, the parcel could hold more water vapor than it currently does. The partial pressure exerted by the water vapor is given by \\(e\\), whereas the partial pressure that would be exerted by the water vapor if the parcel were saturated, is e*, which is a function of temperature: i.e., \\(e*(T)\\). (Units: kPa).\nVapor pressure deficit, VPD: Vapor pressure deficit represents the difference between the actual and saturation vapor pressures of a parcel at temperature T:\n\\[\nVPD = e*(T) - e\n\\tag{5}\\]\n\nNote: that the smaller the VPD, the closer the parcel is to saturation.

    "text": "Theory\nThe environmental lapse rate (ELR) is the actual rate of air temperature decrease or increase with height in the atmosphere, i.e. as measured by thermometers at different heights. The daily average ELR is typically about 0.006 K m-1 but may vary considerably.\nThe dry adiabatic lapse rate (Γd) is the temperature change of a dry (unsaturated) air parcel as the parcel moves up for down in the atmosphere. This is a process lapse rate. The parcel is assumed not to mix with the environment but allowed to change its volume - it is said to behave adiabatically. Γd is a constant with a value of 0.01 K m-1.\nIf you look at the difference between those two lapse rates - ELR vs. Γd - you can assess the static stability of a particular air layer:\nELR > Γd: unstable. For an air parcel, a slight upward displacement will result in a continuous rise of the parcel because the parcel will become warmer and less dense than the surrounding air at the same height and therefore possesses buoyancy. Conversely, if the air parcel is displaced below, it will become cooler and more dense than the surrounding air at the same height, and it will tend to continue sinking. In an unstable layer, vertical movements are enhanced.\nELR = Γd: neutral. There will be no tendency for a parcel to rise or sink after it is displaced either above or below because it cools or warms at exactly the same rate as the surrounding air. Therefore, the parcel will come to rest after the displacing force is removed.\nELR < Γd: stable. If an air parcel is displaced upwards, it will become cooler and more dense than the surrounding air and tend to sink back to its original location. If displaced below, it will find itself warmer and tend to rise back up to its original location. In a stable layer, vertical movements are suppressed. In very stable conditions, smoke and other air pollutants accumulate and often cause respiratory problems.\nTo facilitate comparison between the ELR and the dry adiabatic lapse rate, atmospheric scientists prefer to convert environmental (measured) temperatures T at a particular height z to potential temperatures θ by:\n\\[\n\\theta(z) = T(z) + \\Gamma_d z                           \n\\tag{1}\\]\nNote: θ(z) is the potential temperature at height z and T(z) is the temperature at height z. No need to multiply them by z.\nPotential temperatures have the advantage that we can easily determine the stability of a layer on a graph: a decreasing potential temperature with height indicates an unstable layer, a constant potential temperature with height indicates a neutral layer, and an increasing potential temperature with height indicates a stable layer. This is true because the dry adiabatic lapse rate, Γd, plots as a vertical line on a graph of potential temperature vs. height (by definition).\nThe layer of air closest to the Earth’s surface - the planetary boundary layer (PBL) - changes its vertical temperature distribution often throughout the 24-hour diurnal cycle because here air temperature is strongly affected by surface conditions. The PBL is modified during the day by radiative heating of the surface, which generates buoyancy and warms up the lower atmosphere, resulting in typically unstable conditions close to the ground. The daytime boundary layer is termed the mixed layer whose depth h* may be defined as the height to which buoyant dry air parcels rise adiabatically.\nAt night, radiative cooling of the ground surface indicates that the atmosphere close to the ground will cool down as well, and the near-surface air becomes stable. Therefore, the mixed layer is largely destroyed at night and is replaced at low-level by a stable inversion layer.\n7.3 Calculations"

    "text": "This Lab Assignment is Due: Nov 24 2023\nThis assignment is worth 0 points.\n\n1 Objectives:\n\nDefine terms used in the energy equation.\nKnow how to convert between QE (latent heat flux) and E (evapotranspiration).\nExplain the Bowen ratio () and how to estimate QE if  is known.\n\nTheory: The surface energy balance is a fundamental budget approach that describes the energy exchange at surface-atmosphere interfaces. It is based on the conservation equation of energy that says that energy can neither be created or destroyed by any ordinary means. The surface energy balance is essential to estimate evaporative water loss, cooling rates, growing conditions, frost damage, and many other important processes in natural and managed ecosystems.\nThe energy balance concept can be expressed as:\nEnergy Inputs = Energy Outputs + Energy Storage\nThe energy balance of an ecosystem is shown diagrammatically in the figure below. Positive values of the net radiation, Q* mean that the net flow of radiant energy is into the system (i.e., Q* is directed towards the surface); negative values mean the converse (i.e., Q* is directed away from the surface). This convention is used because Q* is regarded as an input to the system. Positive values of the sensible heat density, QH, the latent heat flux density, QE, and the soil heat flux density, QG, mean that energy is flowing out of the system (i.e., away from the surface); negative values mean the converse (i.e., towards the surface). This is because QH, QE and QG are regarded as outputs from the system.\nFigure 8.1 Schematic of the energy balance of an ecosystem.\nPositive values of the energy storage within the system, mean that the system is accumulating energy; negative values mean that the system is losing energy. Energy may be stored as sensible and latent heat in the canopy air QS, and chemical energy (photosynthesis) QP in the plants. Energy storage as a result of horizontal energy transport (advection) can occur in tall crops (e.g., orchards) and forests, particularly near their borders. The energy balance equation for a crop volume assuming no horizontal energy divergence may, therefore, be written as: (8.1) The energy balance approach is often used to estimate the evaporative water loss, E from ecosystems such as crops and forests. The latent heat flux density QE is the energy used to evaporate water in the stomata (transpiration) and evaporate water in the soil near the soil surface (evaporation from the soil). The sum of transpiration and evaporation from the soil is evapotranspiration.\nNet radiation is measured directly by a net radiometer which is usually located 1 to 3 metres above a crop (i.e., shorter vegetation) or 10 m above a forest (i.e., taller vegetation). It may be either a single-differential-thermopile net radiometer with upward- and downward-facing polyethylene domes that transmit shortwave and longwave radiation (as you saw at Totem field) or a four-way net radiometer consisting of upward- and downward-facing pyranometers and pyrgeometers (as shown in Lecture slides).\nSoil heat flux density QG is measured by soil heat flux plates usually placed 2 to 5 cm below the soil surface. Thermometers and humidity sensors are used to determine the sensible and latent energy storage within a canopy Qs. Leaf chambers (cuvettes) can be used to measure net CO2 uptake by leaves or the eddy-covariance approach can be used to measure the CO2 uptake by the canopy as a whole. Biochemical energy storage QP can be calculated from the CO2 uptake rate. Canopy energy storage Qs is often neglected because it is generally small compared to Q*.\nThe latent and sensible heat flux densities are the most difficult terms in 8.1 to determine. Although there are a few ways to estimate these terms, today they are often measured directly using the eddy covariance technique.\nThe latent heat flux density QE can be used to calculate the evapotranspiration rate, E in m s-1 (typically converted to mm h-1) is calculated from: (8.2) where Lv is the latent heat of vaporization of water (assume a constant of 2,448,000 J kg-1) and water is the density of water (1000 kg m-3). Note that QE = 680 W m-2 is equivalent to E = 1 mm h-1, i.e., the evaporation of a layer of water 1 mm deep in one hour.\nThe Bowen ratio  is defined as: (8.3)\nIf  is known, QE can be calculated as (assuming QP is negligible): (8.4) Calculations and Questions: [9 marks]\nQ1. Show that a latent heat flux density of 680 W m-2 is equivalent to an evaporation rate of 1 mm h-1. [0.5]\nQ2. Based on measurements collected at a restored peatland site in Burns Bog (the site BB2 in this map), what is the value of the net all-wave radiation at noon on July 29th, 2022. If all this energy were used in evapotranspiration, what would the evapotranspiration rate be? Make sure to show your calculations to receive full marks and report E in mm/h. [1.5]\nQ3. How does this compare to the actual measured evapotranspiration rate derived from measurements of QE? Make sure to show your calculations to receive full marks and report E in mm/h. [1]\nQ4. Compare the daytime values of  for Table 8.1 and 8.2. What difference does this imply in the proportion of net radiation (Q*) that was used in evapotranspiration for the hay crop and Douglas-fir stand?

Also included are values of short-wave irradiance K.\nQ5. Calculate and fill in the missing 1-h values of QH and QE in W m-2.

Thus, net ecosystem productivity NEP is (8.2) Soil respiration (Rs), which can account for as much as 80% of Re, results in the efflux of CO2 from the soil. Rs is composed of the CO2 produced by microbial decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) (heterotrophic respiration, Rsh) and by root respiration (autotrophic respiration, Rsa), i.e., (8.3) The autotrophic respiration of stems, branches and leaves accounts for the remainder of Re.\nTemperature T, followed by soil moisture, is the most important environmental factor affecting Rs (and all its components). It increases exponentially with T, which is often expressed as (8.4) where Rref is Rs at a reference temperature Tref, usually 10 °C, and Q10 is the relative increase in Rs (or Re) for a 10 K increase in T. Q10 is about 2 in many biological processes but is frequently found to be as much as 3 for Re and Rs. As an example of using Eq. 8.4, assuming Q10 = 2 and Tref = 10 °C, when T = 20 °C, Rs = Rref2[(20-10)/10] = 2 Rref. Can you show that for T = 30 °C, Rs would be 4 times that at Tref?\nThis sensitivity, which is particularly important in predicting the effects of global warming, depends on the quality (i.e., labile or recalcitrant) and quantity of substrate and thus productivity and soil temperature and moisture. The soil is the largest terrestrial carbon pool. It is particularly vulnerable to warming and its potential loss may result in a `positive feedback’ effect, i.e., increased atmospheric CO2, which could lead to further global warming as a result of the greenhouse effect (Cox et al. 2000). In addition to T and soil moisture, Rsh depends on SOM content and its recalcitrance.\nA widely used method of measuring Rs is the closed or static chamber method. In this method, the rate of increase in CO2 concentration in a chamber placed on the soil surface is used to determine the soil CO2 efflux (Livingston and Hutchinson, 1995). This is a good measure of Rs because very little of the respired CO2 accumulates in the soil. Thus, Rs can be calculated using (8.5) where  is the molar density of air (40 mol m-3), V is the volume of the chamber (m3), A is the area of the ground covered by the chamber (m2), and r is the rate of increase in CO2 concentration (µmol mol-1 s-1 or ppm s-1), which is calculated by (8.6) Using these units in Eq. 8.5 gives Rs in units of µmol m-2 s-1. The CO2 concentration in the chamber is measured with an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA). If the chamber is kept on the soil for less than 2 minutes, r is almost constant. This means the rise in chamber CO2 concentration does not significantly suppress CO2 efflux. Because CO2 concentration changes during the measurement, the measurement apparatus is described as a non-steady-state system.\nObjectives: • To measure Rs of agricultural (bare) fertilized and unfertilized soils. • To determine the sensitivity of Rs, by comparing the magnitude of Rs from agricultural (bare) fertilized and unfertilized soils.\nThe soils were collected from the Delta region, which are Gleysolic soils with silty clay loam texture. One soil was fertilized with urea fertilizer (46-0-0). both soils have been watered equally to obtain a soil volumetric water content close to field capacity (~25-35%).\nExperimental procedure 1. Allow the instructor/assistant to bring up the soil greenhouse gas software. 2. Plug in your Vaisala GMP252 Carbon dioxide probe into an electrical socket. 3. Wait 1-2 minutes for the sensor to start measuring, and for the screen to appear on the projector screen. 4. Ensure that the Vaisala GMP252 Carbon dioxide probe’s opening is facing the table. Allow the probe a sufficient amount of time to equilibrate to atmospheric conditions – this can be recognized by a flat reading approximately 400-500 ppm for 2-3 minutes. This typically can take 4-5 minutes from startup of the probe. 5. Insert one thermometer approximately 5 cm into the soil. 6. At the top of the measurement sheet record the soil treatment you are working on. 7. Using the display screen a. Using the rubber end of the pencil you can gently tap on the display to perform certain functions. i. Resize the graph – tapping in the top left-hand corner\n\nRestart the graph – tapping in the top right-hand corner\nObtain an estimate flux – tapping at the start of the increase in the CO2 graph will allow you to select a point. It will then generate a line and slope automatically using a 60 second time interval. This slope is an approximate value for the flux of CO2.\n\n\nOnce the probe has equilibrated, you can gently pick the sensor up and place it onto the soil gas collar that has already been inserted into the soil.\nSet up a timer on your smartphone or a stopwatch, start the timer and record the initial ppm of CO2. Record all data (in this step and below) in the ‘Soil Respiration Data Collection Sheet-2022 WT1.xlsx’ spreadsheet.\nEvery 30 seconds, record the concentration of carbon dioxide (ppm) displayed on the CO2 sensor screen for 180 seconds (3 minutes). Put this data into the excel sheet.\nAfter the 180 seconds: Using the eraser end of the pencil, gently tap on the screen at the start of the increase in CO2 concentration where there is a relatively straight line. This will give you an approximate CO2 flux. Record this value in the “Slope on display” row in the excel sheet. You can tap on the top left hand of the screen to resize the curve if needed, and refresh the screen by tapping on the top right-hand side.\nOnce you have found the slope, remove the sensor from the soil collar. Gently wave it around to get airflow around the sensor for a few seconds.\nFlip the sensor back over so that the probe is facing down towards the table again for 2-3 minutes until it reaches a constant measurement. Note: the equilibrated concentration of CO2 could change due to the amount of people in the room respiring.\nRecord in excel the soil temperature from the thermometer.\nUse the TDR to measure soil volumetric water content (VWC %) around the soil gas collar. Ensure that the measurement mode is set to the correct soil type for your experiment. Take 3 or 4 measurements around the collar and use the average soil water content as water may not be evenly distributed throughout the soil. Record this in the excel sheets.\nRepeat steps 7-15 on each of the soils 3 times in order to obtain an average gas flux measurement.\n\nCalculations and Questions: [9 marks]\nQ1. Plot the change in ppm versus time(s) for each of your soils (and replicates), and calculate the slope ΔCO2/Δt (ppm CO2 s-1). Plots should preferably be done using excel, and don’t forget to label the x- and y-axes (with units) and include a figure caption. The ΔCO2/Δt can be calculated from a linear trend line fitted to the data (see example from TA). [2]\nQ2. For each soil, convert the measured CO2 increase (ppm CO2 s-1) to flux density, Rs (µmol m-2 s-1) using equation 8.5. Obtain values for ρ, V and A from the table above. [2]\nQ3. Which soil, unfertilized or fertilized, has the highest value of Rs. How can you explain any potential differences in Rs between the two soils. Make sure to include at least one citation from a peer-reviewed paper in your explanation [2]\nQ4. Would you expect respiration in layers deeper in the soil to be higher or lower than the values you measured for these surface samples? Why? [1]\nQ5. How would you expect Rs from the unfertilized soil to change with warming? Why? What is meant by a climate feedback effect? Distinguish between and positive and negative feedback. [2]"

I am a geographer, researcher, and educator who has been living as an uninvited guest on unceded Coast Salish Territory since 2015. I received a PhD in geography from UBC in 2022 and am now working for the UBC Micrometeorology group. I study greenhouse gas exchange in wetland ecosystems and associated feedback mechanisms that influence the earth’s climate system. My principal aims this semester are to give you a broad overview to the dynamics governing of weather and climate and to provide you with a supportive learning environment."

There will be Lab, 12 laboratory exercises that can be completed durring your lab section. Lab attendance is not mandatory, but it is strongly recommended as it is the best time to get help from your TA. The weight of each course component towards your final grade is shown in Table 1 and important deadlines are listed in Table 2.\n\nEvaluation\nLab exercises and the final exam will make up the largest portions of your grade, followed the lecture review quizzes and lecture participation will make up the remaining portion of your grade.

    "text": "Academic Integrity\nThe academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed.\nPlagiarism and cheating will be taken very seriously. The first incident of plagiarism/copying/cheating will result in a zero for the assignment. Further incidents will be reported to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline in addition to a zero. A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found here\nThough you may work together with your classmates on the assignments and help each other, ALL STUDENTS MUST SUBMIT THEIR OWN ORIGINAL WORK. This means that your maps must be your own, and your answers must be in your own words. Failure to submit your own work can result in failing the assignment or worse, so please be careful. See the Academic Integrity section of the Syllabus for more information."

My undergraduate thesis research investigated the impacts of fire on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes (CO2, CH4, and N2O) within different burned zones of a bog. The methodology incorporated chamber measurements and gas chromatography for the analysis. Currently, as a second-year MSc student, I am examining the impacts of seedling removal — a post-fire management practice — on the GHG fluxes (CO2 and CH4) within the 2016 burned zone of the Burns Bog, Delta, BC. This research utilizes a smart chamber with a portable analyzer.

I am a fourth-year PhD candidate collaborating under the guidance of Dr. Sara Knox in Geography. I am interested in understanding the key processes underlying the carbon cycle between the atmosphere and coastal wetland ecosystem. Moreover, I am dedicated to quantifying how greenhouse gas fluxes in coastal wetlands contribute to regional and global carbon cycles. Currently, my research has been conducted in both the Delta and Richmond regions of British Columbia, measuring continuous carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchanges in tidal marshes. I’m delighted to be a part of this exciting course as one of the TAs in GEOS200.

Remember that:\nEnergy is the ability to do work, and work is done when unit force acts over unit distance: 1 N x 1 m = 1 Joule (J)\nTemperature is the ability of a body to transfer thermal energy to another body. It is a measure of the random kinetic energy or the average thermal energy of its molecules (in K or C)."
