The amount in moles of a given gas can be defined as \\(n = \\frac{m}{M}\\), where \\(m\\) is the mass of the substance (in kg or g) and \\(M\\) is the Molar mass (in kg mol-1 or g mol-1) respectively. The molar mass of water (in g mol-1) is listed in Table 1. The Ideal Gas Law generally applies to water vapor as it does other gasses and can be used to help explain some important relationships.\n\\[\nPV=nRT\n\\tag{1}\\]\nTwo key metrics we use to describe atmospheric moisture in meteorology are:\n\nVapor density: \\(\\rho_v\\)\n\n\nThis metric quantifies the density of water vapor within a parcel of air and is typically given in g m-3\n\nIt describes mass of H20 vapor (in grams) per unit volume (cubic meter) of air, i.e. \\(\\frac{m_{H2O}}{V}\\).\n\n\n\nVapor pressure: \\(P_v\\)\n\n\nThis metric quantifies the partial pressure exerted by the water vapor in a parcel of air and is typically given in kPa.\n\nThe pressure exerted by the water vapor in the atmosphere, is only a small portion of the total pressure exerted by the atmosphere.

    "section": "Saturation",
    "text": "Saturation\nUnder the pressures and temperature conditions experienced on Earth the atmosphere can only hold a small amount of water vapor before it becomes saturated. We add an asterisk to \\(\\rho_v^*\\) and \\(P_v^*\\) to denote saturation vapor density and saturation vapor pressure respectively. Once the atmosphere reaches saturation point, H2O vapor in the air will begin to condense into its liquid form.\nDetermining exact value of \\(\\rho_v^*\\) and \\(P_v^*\\) for a specific value of \\(T\\) isn’t a straightforward calculation. This is because we need to consider the latent heat of vaporization (recall this term for lecture). When water changes phase, it adds (condensation/freezing) or removes (evaporation/melting) a massive amount of energy from its surrounding environment. Calculating \\(\\rho_v^*\\) and \\(P_v^*\\) exactly involves using some calculus to evaluate a differential equation known as the Clausius–Clapeyron relation. But don’t worry, we’re not going to make you do any calculus here. Empirically derived relationships have been derived to help simplify the calculations. On such relationship, is known as the Buck equation (Equation 3). Note: this empirical equation requires \\(T\\) to be in \\(^\\circ C\\), instead of \\(K\\), which is different from most from many others. The ideal gas law Equation 1 and it’s variant Equation 2 require temperature to be in K.\n\\[\nP_v^*=0.61121e^{(18.678-\\frac{T}{234.5})(\\frac{T}{257.14+T})}\n\\tag{3}\\]\nBy evaluating Equation 3, we can come up with an accurate approximation for \\(P_v^*\\) to a high degree of accuracy (\\(\\pm\\) 0.08%) within the ranges of temperatures and pressures typically observed on Earths surface. We can then plug the result into Equation 2 to solve for \\(\\rho_v\\). Remembering to convert our temperature values to K in order to evaluate this variant of the ideal gas law. The R code shown in Example 1 shows how you could perform these calculations in programmatically. Figure 1 shows the output of Equation 3, i.e., how \\(P_v\\) varies with \\(T\\) for selected temperatures. Figure 2 shows the output of Equation 2 for given values of \\(T\\) and \\(P_v\\).\n\nExample 1 Functions to evaluate the Buck Equation and Ideal Gas Law. Functions are pieces of code that can be defined once an run numerous times. They make performing calculations that need to be repeated much easier.

    "text": "Humidity\nThere are other ways of expressing the amount of moisture in the atmosphere; each has particular usefulness in certain applications. For example, relative humidity (RH); it is a given as a percentage (0-100%) and is the most commonly reported metric for humidity. When \\(RH = 100%\\), it indicates the atmosphere is saturated; when \\(RH &lt; 100%\\), it indicates the atmosphere is not saturated. Relative humidity is the ratio of \\(/rho_v\\) for a given parcel of air at a certain \\(T\\) relative to the maximum possible \\(\\rho_v^*\\) the parcel of air could have at that \\(T\\), as shown in Equation 4.\n\\[\nRH = \\frac{\\rho_v}{\\rho_v^*}\n\\tag{4}\\]\nNote: if you have a parcel with a known \\(\\rho_v\\) and a known \\(T\\), you can use Figure 2 to lookup the value of \\(\\rho_v^*\\) to evaluate Equation 4. Alternatively - you could also evaluate Equation 3 and Equation 2 to get \\(\\rho_v^*\\) and then evaluate Equation 4. This metric is useful because it can convey the relative saturation of the atmosphere without us having to know the absolute values. However, it can also be deceptive, because the two air parcels (one at 0 \\(^{\\circ}\\) C and one at 20 \\(^{\\circ}\\) C) that both have \\(RH = 100%\\) will contain significantly different amounts of water vapor in absolute terms.\nThe other commonly reported metric in every-day life is the dewpoint (\\(T_d\\)). This is the air temperature at which a parcel of air with a given \\(\\rho_v\\) would be saturated. If you have a parcel of air with known \\(\\rho_v\\), the value of \\(T\\) that corresponds to \\(\\rho_v\\) in Figure 2 would be it’s dewpoint. This metric is useful because it quantifies the absolute moisture content of a parcel of air (unlike \\(RH\\)). However - two parcels of air can have the same \\(T_d\\) while having drastically different air temperatures. Both \\(RH\\) and \\(T_d\\) are limited (in different ways) because they don’t convey the full picture; but they are still useful in day-to-day life as they are relatively easy to understand."

There are two variants of this instrument, but they have the same key components. They consist of a pair of a ventilated pair of thermometers, one of which has a wetted wick covering the bulb of the thermometer. The wet-bulb is cooled by evaporation to a value known as the “wet-bulb temperature” (\\(T_w\\)). If we have a measurement of both \\(T\\) (aka “dry-bulb” temperature) and \\(T_w\\) (aka “wet-bulb” temperature) we can calculate \\(\\rho_v\\) using Equation 7; where \\(\\rho_{vw}^*\\) is the saturation vapor density at \\(T_w\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) is the psychrometric constant (see Table 1). The value of \\(\\rho_{vw}^*\\) can be found by looking up \\(T_w\\) in Figure 2, or by plugging \\(T_w\\) into Equation 3 and Equation 2.\nWet bulb temperature (\\(T_w\\)) is also a useful metric, because it gives us the minimum temperature to which an object can be cooled via evaporation, under different temperature and humidity conditions.

By 1961 the UBC Climatological Station had achieved the necessary standards to be classed as an Ordinary Climatological Station by the Environment Canada Climatological Network (Hare and Thomas, 1979). In the early 1970s, campus development forced its relocation further south, to the Totem Research Station (Figure 2). The station is located 100m a.s.l. with an open exposure to the majority of the climatic elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Location of Totem Climate Station\n\n\n\nStandardization\nAny site of a climatological station must meet basic criteria before its data will be accepted by Environment Canada. For example, the surroundings must be reasonably flat, there should be no major obstacles to airflow, no significant obstruction to the horizon, no extraneous sources of heat, vapor or dust and the surface should consist of short grass. Similarly, the instrumentation must conform to Environment Canada standards. The data gathered from a climatological station are to be related to large-scale air mass and regional characteristics not the microclimate of the site. Insistence on these points assures users of site and instrument standardization so that different stations can be compared within expected limits of accuracy."

Shortwave radiation is also know as solar radiation, because it is the primary wavelength of radiation emitted from the Sun. The pyranometer contains a small black absorber disk inside a glass dome whose radiative properties allow only radiation with wavelengths (\\(\\mu\\)) between 0.3 and 3 \\(\\mu m\\) to pass through. As radiation reaches the absorber disk, it will warm up and create a temperature difference to the rest of the body of the instrument whose temperature varies only slowly. The difference can be directly related to short-wave receipt.\nFigure 3 (b) shows a pyrgeometer, which is used to measure the thermal radiation, also know as long-wave (LW) radiation. It works in a similar way as a pyranometer, except it measures wavelengths between 4.5 and 100 µm. Figure 3 (c) shows how sets of pyranometers and pyrgeometers, one of each pointing upward toward the sky and downward toward the ground, are used to measure both incoming and outgoing short-wave and long-wave radiation respectively. We’ll take a more in depth look at radiation in lab 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Pyranometer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Pyrgeometer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Typical radiation measurement setup\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Instrumentation used to measure radiation\n\n\n\n\nAir & Soil Temperature\nAir temperature and humidity are measured in a Stevenson screen Figure 4 designed to protect the instruments from liquid water (rain/snow) and shade them from solar radiation, but permit free air circulation.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Stevenson Screen\n\n\nSoil temperatures are measured using Copper/Constantan thermocouples. These are wires made up of two different metals that carry a small electrical signal. The transfer of electricity between the two metals is dependent upon temperature, and from that we can calculate temperature for whatever medium the thermocouple is in contact with.\n\nFigure 5 shows an example of air and soil temperature data collected at Totem field during the 2021 Heatdome.\n\nYou can move your cursor over the traces (lines) to see the values of the different variables.\nThink about how air and soil temperatures compare to one another in this example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Temperature data from Totem Field during the 2021 Heatdome.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecipitation\nRainfall is measured using a tipping bucket Figure 6 (b), which works by funneling precipitation into small seesaw-like counter Figure 6. The depth of new snowfall and the total depth of the snow lying on the ground was historically measured with a meter stick. It is now measured using an automated sonic snow depth sensor Figure 6 (c).\n\nLiquid water equivalent of the snow is typically estimated using a 10:1 ratio\n\n10 mm of snow ≈ 1 mm of rainfall\n\nHowever, this is just an average, and accuracy of this estimate can vary drastically depending on the type of snow.\n\nIn Vancouver, we typically get “wet, heavy snow” which has a much higher liquid water equivalent, with a ratio closer to 5:1. Using the standard 10:1 ratio for a typical Vancouver snowfall would underestimate liquid precipitation.\n“Powder”, the light, fluffy snow common in dry mountainous areas that makes for great skiing has a much lower liquid water equivalent, with a ratio closer to 20:1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Inside a Tipping bucket\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Tipping bucket\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Snow depth sensor\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Instrumentation used to measure precipitation (rain and snow).\n\n\n\nFigure 7 shows an example of precipitation data collected at Totem field during November 2021, when an Atmospheric River caused widespread flooding across the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Precipitation data from Totem Field during the 2021 Atmospheric River event.\n\n\n\n\n\nWind Speed\nWind speed (horizontal) and direction are measured on a prop vane anemometer Figure 8.

Discuss why or why not. You can pan around and zoom in/out on Figure 2 to help you answer this question.\nAnswer:\n\nGenerally speaking its going to be broadly representative of the areas climate conditions however the nearby trees may cause some issues with the wind observations\nSince its in an area without dense buildings/concrete, there is some bias relative to conditions farther north on campus which is more densely developed.\n\nNote For TA\nBe flexible with this one if they don’t mention these exact points but still give a well thought out answer.\n\n\nQuestion 2 [1 points]\nWhy is a Stevenson screen built with slatted walls, a double roof, and white paint?\nAnswer:\n\nTo shield the thermistor from radiation while allowing air to pass through.\nThe white paint and the double roof are chosen to effectively reflect short-wave (solar) radiation and prevent warming up of the interior of the screen above air temperature. Short wave-radiation reaching a thermometer would be absorbed and warm it up.\nThe slatted walls still allow airflow through the screen to keep thermometers near air temperature. Otherwise, in a closed box, the interior temperature of the box would not correspond to air temperature anymore (decoupled).\n\n\n\nQuestion 3 [1 points]\nHow do air and soil temperatures compare to one another during the 2021 Heatdome event shown in Figure 5? Which variable (air or soil temperature at 10/20/40 cm) has the largest range on a daily basis? Which has the smallest range?\nAnswer:\n\nSoil temperatures are less variable than air temperatures (i.e., they’re buffered from extreme changes) on both. Soil temps also lag behind air temperatures and decrease with depth in the summer.\nThe air temperature range is greatest, up to 10 C / day during the heat dome - 5 cm soil T is &lt; 5 C/day, 40 cm barely changes on a daily basis.\n\nNote: (Extra context)\n\nIt takes much more energy to raise the temperature of a volume of soil than it does an equivalent volume of air.\n\n\n\nQuestion 4 [0.5 points]\nFill in the blank(s): indicate the words/phrases that complete the statement.\nUsing the standard 10:1 ratio for “Powder” snow in a dry mountainous region would ______ liquid precipitation.\nAnswer:\n\nOverestimate\n\nNote For TA\nDon’t need exact wording - accept synonymous answers.\n\n\nQuestion 5 [1 points]\nBased on Figure 9, do you think the wind data from the last few years at totem field is accurate? Why or why not?\nAnswer:\n\nNot reliable - systematic shift in recent years"

Do you think conditions at the rooftop site are representative of the conditions in the surrounding area?

Yet at the same time, the lands have been claimed by Canada and these First Nations living on these lands lack a framework to express their sovereignty. This by no means absolves the Canadian government of their crimes where lands were “ceded” by treaty. Treaties were more frequently reached by coercion than negotiation.

The earth (as a whole) also does not transmit short-wave radiation (\\(\\tau_{SW}\\)). However objects on or near its surface, such as leaves can Figure 1. When dealing with an opaque object such as a the surface of the earth, we can define absorption as Equation 5, but when dealing with transparent objects such as leaves or water, we must define absorption as Equation 6:\n\\[\na_{\\lambda} = 1  - \\alpha_{\\lambda}\n\\tag{5}\\]\n\\[\na_{\\lambda} = 1  - \\alpha_{\\lambda} - \\tau_{\\lambda}\n\\tag{6}\\]\n\nNote Equation 1 and Equation 6 are equivalent to one another.\nNote you can calculate \\(\\tau\\) using the same approach as in Equation 4, you would just use transmitted \\(SW\\) in the numerator instead of reflected \\(SW\\)\n\nFollowing Equation 5, any short-wave radiation that is not reelected by the Earth’s surface, will be absorbed. When short-wave radiation is absorbed, the energy is “transformed” from one form to another. Some of the energy goes towards phase changes of water, some of it goes into chemical reactions (e.g., photosynthesis), and a large portion of it is re-emitted as outgoing long-wave radiation (\\(LW\\uparrow\\)), aka. thermal radiation.

Net radiation can tell us how much energy is entering (positive) or leaving (negative) the site at any given time. If net \\((R_n)\\) is a large positive number, that indicates significant energy input, which would cause the land surface at the site to warm up.

If the sensor is held too close to the surface, it will “see” too much of its own shadow. Read the voltage from the meter.\nCalculate the coefficient of reflection \\(\\alpha_{\\lambda}\\) for the fluorescent lamp-soil combination: hint see Equation 1, Equation 4 and Equation 5\nExchange the fluorescent lamp for the incandescent lamp. It is suggested to keep room lights switched off during measurements involving incandescent lamps. Why? Measure the coefficient of reflection \\(\\alpha_{\\lambda}\\) for the incandescent lamp-soil combination.\nRepeat this procedure for all soil samples under both light sources. Calculate coefficients of reflection \\(\\alpha_{SW}\\) as well as absorption \\(a_{SW}\\) for all samples. Note, here: \\(\\tau_{\\lambda} = 0\\)\nMeasure incident, reflected and transmitted light of a green leaf - separately for both light sources. In addition to the measurements above, without moving the leaf, place the radiation sensor under the leaf with the sensitive side upwards. Calculate the coefficients of transmission by: hint see Equation 1, Equation 4 and Equation 6\nRepeat the procedure for a yellow or brown autumnal leaf. Calculate the coefficients of reflection \\(\\alpha_{SW}\\) , transmission \\(\\tau_{\\lambda} = 0\\) and absorption \\(a_{SW}\\) for the fluorescent and incandescent radiation on the leaf."

This system uses a small number of base units from which other derived units can be obtained. The SI base units are listed in Table 1 and should be used whenever applicable in this course.\n\nThe unit for temperature is Kelvin (K, not \\(^{\\circ} K\\)). Temperatures may be also indicated in degree Celsius ( \\(^{\\circ} C\\) ). However, temperature-differences should be referred to as Kelvin (K). The conversion is listed in Equation 12. Note how one Kelvin is equivalent to one degree Celsius, but the units have different zero points.\n\n0 K represents absolute zero, which is the lowest possible temperature: i.e., a complete lack of energy in a system.\n\nKelvin is on a ratio scale: it starts at a fixed, meaningful zero value and can only take positive values. This allows for relative comparisons between values:\n\ne.ge., 100 K is “twice as hot” as 50 K\n\n\n\\(^{\\circ} C\\) is the freezing point of fresh water at 1 atm (mean atmospheric pressure at sea level).\n\nCelsius is on an interval scale &gt; it has an arbitrary zero value and can take positive or negative values. This prevents relative comparisons between values:\n\ne.ge., 100 \\(^{\\circ} C\\) is not “twice as hot” as 50 \\(^{\\circ} C\\)\n\n\n\nYou can use the following equation to convert between Celsius and Kelvin:\n\n\\[\nT(K) = T(\\deg C) + 273.15\n\\tag{1}\\]\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: SI Base Units.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSI base unit\nSymbol\nQuantity\n\n\n\n\nMeter\nm\nLength\n\n\nKilogram\nKg\nMass\n\n\nSecond\ns\nTime\n\n\nKelvin\nK\nThermodynamic Temperature\n\n\nAmpere\nA\nElectric current\n\n\nMole\nmol\nAmount of a substance\n\n\nCandela\ncd\nLuminous intensity"
