    "text": "The University of British Columbia and the city of Vancouver are on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples. Specifically the UBC Vancouver campus is on xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) land.\n\nThere are nearly 200 First Nations spread through BC, and many more across the continent.\n\nIt is essential to recognize Indigenous territories and Indigenous sovereignty, especially within the context of geography courses.\nTo learn more about the Indigenous people, culture, and languages where you live and around the world, check out native-land.ca.\n\n\n\n\n\nMap Source\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Do an Acknowledgement?\nA land acknowledgement is meant to convey a deep rooted cultural connection to the land and the historical and present day injustices and violence enacted on Indigenous communities through colonialism. For centuries, settler societies have perpetuated a genocide against Indigenous people across the globe. In many ways this genocide is still ongoing here in British Columbia and across Canada. There has been concerted effort by the government, religious organizations, and educational institutions to erase Indigenous culture and identity which as marginalized these communities in Canadian Society.\n\nAn acknowledgement is one small way to help with that, but it cannot be treated as a formality. It is a time to reflect and build understanding.\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\n\nTraditional and Ancestral Recognize by whom the lands were traditionally used and/or occupied and the cultures have been handed down from generation to generation. The area around UBC was used by many different people, including the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm, əl̓ilwətaɁɬ, and Skwxwú7mesh-ulh Nations.\nThese people are are part of a broader linguistic / cultural group of Coast Salish speaking people. The xʷməθkʷəy̓əm and əl̓ilwətaɁɬ speak dialects of Hul’q’umi’num’ / Halq’eméylem / hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓ and the Skwxwú7mesh-ulh speak Sḵwx̱wú7mesh sníchim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnceded: Refers to land that was not turned over to the government by a treaty or other agreement. Over 95% of the land in BC, and many lands elsewhere in the world were never ceded by treaty. Without treaties, these lands remain the sovereign territory of the First Nations that call them home. Yet at the same time, the lands have been claimed by Canada and these First Nations living on these lands lack a framework to express their sovereignty. This by no means absolves the Canadian government of their crimes where lands were “ceded” by treaty. Treaties were more frequently reached by coercion than negotiation. The RCMP was created specifically to force indigenous people off their lands by any means necessary."

Even if you cannot attend lectures in-person, I expect all student to actively participate in the class. Active participation means that you come to class prepared having read all the materials assigned for each lecture and/or stay up to date on watching lectures and readings even if you are unable to attend lectures. When attending lectures (either in-person on synchronously online), I encourage you to actively participate in discussions and class activities to create an engaging and dynamic learning environment.\nLectures are held in person Wednesday & Friday, 9:30 - 11:00 in room Friedman Building, Room 153 with a remote attendance option available on on zoom. Recordings will be made available here for convenience, but lecture participation points are only available during keyInfo.\nLecture participation will be gauged using TopHat. The course Join Code is: .\n\nTopHat questions can only be answered during the lecture session\n\nThey will be available to in person and remote attendees\nThey can be answered via mobile device or laptop\n\nQuestions will be marked based on participation (50%) and correctness (50%)\n\nAnonymized answers will be reviewed in lecture to help gauge comprehension\n\n\nExtra credit will offered at multiple points through the term.\n\nThe course also has a piazza page which can be used to ask/answer questions about assignments and course materials. Students who are active and helpful on the piazza page will be offered extra participation credit at the end of term.\n\n\n\nLab Assignments\nLaboratory exercises are designed to complement the lecture materials and are a mandatory part of the course. The accompanying laboratory exercises provide hands-on experiences explaining physical principles and introducing biometeorological instrumentation.\nLate labs: there will be a deduction of 10%/day for late assignments\nCollaboration on labs is encouraged. However, you should think about the problems yourself before discussing them with others. Also, write-ups must be done independently. (In practice, this means that it is OK for other people to explain their solutions to you, but you must not be looking at other people’s solutions as you write your own.)\nQuizzes are available to you from 7am to 11:59pm on the day they are listed in the course schedule above and on Canvas. You will have 20 minutes to complete the quiz once you start it on Canvas. Quizzes are open book, but please make sure to follow the guidelines below on Academic Honesty.\nThe final exam will be an in-person final scheduled during the scheduled exam period. The final exam will be closed-book.\n\n\nFinal Exam\nThe final exam will be will be cumulative, drawing from both lecture and lab material. It will consist of a flowchart question illustrating how to complete a GIS task, essays/short answers, and miscellaneous fill in the blanks, matching, multiple choice, etc. type questions. It will be asynchronous over Canvas and is scheduled for TBD. More info will be available closer to the exam date."

    "text": "Academic Integrity\nThe academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed.\nPlagiarism and cheating will be taken very seriously. The first incident of plagiarism/copying/cheating will result in a zero for the assignment. Further incidents will be reported to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline in addition to a zero. A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found here\nThough you may work together with your classmates on the assignments and help each other, ALL STUDENTS MUST SUBMIT THEIR OWN ORIGINAL WORK. This means that your maps must be your own, and your answers must be in your own words. Failure to submit your own work can result in failing the assignment or worse, so please be careful. See the Academic Integrity section of the Syllabus for more information."

My undergraduate thesis research investigated the impacts of fire on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes (CO2, CH4, and N2O) within different burned zones of a bog. The methodology incorporated chamber measurements and gas chromatography for the analysis. Currently, as a second-year MSc student, I am examining the impacts of seedling removal — a post-fire management practice — on the GHG fluxes (CO2 and CH4) within the 2016 burned zone of the Burns Bog, Delta, BC. This research utilizes a smart chamber with a portable analyzer. Additionally, I am interested in quantifying the net carbon exchange at the ecosystem scale using eddy covariance techniques and understanding carbon dynamics across varying ecosystem types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nTzu-Yi\n\n\nPronouns\nShe/Her/Hers\n\n\nEmail\ntzuyilu@student.ubc.ca\n\n\nOffice\nGeography room 207\n\n\n\n\n\nMy name is Tzu-Yi. I am a fourth-year PhD candidate collaborating under the guidance of Dr. Sara Knox in Geography. I am interested in understanding the key processes underlying the carbon cycle between the atmosphere and coastal wetland ecosystem. Moreover, I am dedicated to quantifying how greenhouse gas fluxes in coastal wetlands contribute to regional and global carbon cycles. Currently, my research has been conducted in both the Delta and Richmond regions of British Columbia, measuring continuous carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchanges in tidal marshes. I’m delighted to be a part of this exciting course as one of the TAs in GEOS200.
