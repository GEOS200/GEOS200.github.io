    "text": "Weather Balloons\nOur understanding of the vertical structure of Earth’s atmosphere has been informed by over a century of weather balloon launches Figure 1. Modern balloons carry sensors to measure temperature, humidity, and air pressure along with a radiosonde which transmits data back to a station on the ground. The balloons record data as they ascend through the atmosphere, giving us a profile of temperature, humidity, and air pressure. Some balloons are also tracked by GPS, which allows wind speed and direction to be calculated as well. Eventually, the balloon pops and it’s transmitter returns to earth via a parachute. Modern balloons regularly reach heights exceeding 30,000 meters above sea level (m.a.s.l); for reference, commercial aircraft fly between 9,000 and 13,000 m.a.s.l\nFigure 2 shows a web map weather balloon stations that are part the Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive network. Take a moment to look around the map; note the spatial distribution of stations across Earth’s surface. These data are an important component of weather forecasts as they give us information the current state of the upper atmosphere. They are also used to help validate satellite data products, and historical balloon records are use to train global climate models. Balloon launches at most stations are conducted twice daily at 0:00 UTC and 12:00 UTC. Launch times are kept consistent across the globe by using (UTC time)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time] instead of the local time. This is important for standardizing observations so they can be included in global climate models. If you ever need to convert between UTC time and local time, you can use this tool to help.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Photos of weather balloon launches at various points in history\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Location of all currently active Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive (IGRA) weather balloon stations.

    "section": "Atmospheric Profiles",
    "text": "Atmospheric Profiles\nThe atmosphere is a compressible gas; i.e., air is compressed by the weight (pressure) of the air above it. Therefore, density (\\(\\rho\\)) and air pressure (\\(P\\)) decrease with increasing height above the sea level (Figure 3). Note how \\(P\\) decreases steadily with height, from just over 100 kPa at sea level to less than 10 kPa at 20,000 meters above sea level (m.a.s.l). Air pressure always decreases with height, because air pressure is a function of the weight of air above a measurement location. As you move upwards through the atmosphere, the weight of the air above you decreases, so there is less pressure (compressional force) exerted by the remaining air above you and the density of the air decrease. Near Earth’s surface, the decrease is approximately linear (\\(\\approx\\) -0.012 kPa m-1), but the rate of change decrease at higher elevations.\nThe relationship between pressure and density is given by the Ideal Gas Law Equation 1. Recall the notation from Lab 3: pressure (\\(P\\)), volume (\\(V\\)), temperature (\\(T\\)), and the amount of the gas (\\(n\\)) in moles; with \\(R\\) being the ideal gas constant (see Table 1). The amount in moles of a given gas (or mixture of gasses) can be defined as \\(n = \\frac{m}{M}\\), where \\(m\\) is the mass of the substance (in kg or g) and \\(M\\) is the Molar mass (in kg mol-1 or g mol-1) respectively.\n\\[\nPV=nRT\n\\tag{1}\\]\nYou may have noticed this phenomena if you’ve ever been to the top of a tall mountain. Since the atmosphere is less dense on top of a tall mountain, there is less oxygen available with each, and your body has to breathe more heavily to compensate. You probably also noticed that it was cooler atop the mountain. Looking at Equation 1, we can see that a decrease in \\(P\\) can also lead to a decrease in \\(T\\). However, \\(T\\) profiles in the atmosphere aren’t strictly a function of height, as you can see in Figure 3, there are other factors at play, particularly near the surface and above the tropopause.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Atmospheric pressure (\\(P\\)), density (\\(\\rho\\)), and temperature (\\(T\\)) as a function of height above the Earth’s surface. \\(P\\) and \\(T\\) were measured by a balloon launch form Port Hardy, BC 12:00 UTC October 29th, 2023. \\(\\rho\\) was calculated using Equation 1"

    "text": "Adiabatic Processes\nThe rate at which the parcel will cool depends on whether or not it is saturated. Why? Because the amount of water the atmosphere can hold is a function of temperature. In order for a parcel to cool below its dewpoint water vapor must condense, and the process of condensation releases heat to the surrounding environment.\nThe dry adiabatic lapse rate (DALR) applies when a parcel of air is not saturated, and has a constant with a value of -0.01 K m-1. The DALR dictates the rate of cooling if a parcel is being lifted upwards or the rate of warming for a parcel that is descending.\nThe saturated adiabatic lapse rate (SALR) applies once a parcel of air reaches saturation. A saturated parcel still cools as it rises but condensation also occurs which releases latent heat and counteracts some of the cooling. It important to note that the SALR only applies to cooling air, when air warms it will always do so at the DALR, because as soon as the air begins to warm, it will no longer be saturated.\n\n\nThe actual value of the SALR is non-linear function of \\(T\\) and \\(P\\); it is shown for selected values of \\(T\\) and \\(P\\) in Figure 4. Calculating the exact value of the SALR is complex because:\n\n\\(T\\) varies as a function of \\(P\\)\nThe latent heat released by condensation varies as a function of \\(T\\)\nThe amount of water that must condense for a parcel to cool also varies as a function of \\(T\\)\n\nWhile the SALR is not constant you will can see from Figure 4 that changes in \\(T\\) and \\(P\\) have opposing effects on the SALR. A decrease in \\(T\\) increases the SALR while a decrease in \\(P\\) will decrease SALR. Given this, we can assume a constant SALR of -0.005 K m-1 to perform reasonably accurate approximations.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The saturated adiabatic lapse rate (SALR) for selected temperature and pressure values."

Given the Sun’s radius to be 6.96 × 108 m, find the average flux density in W m-2 of solar (short-wave) radiation leaving the Sun’s surface.

    "text": "The University of British Columbia and the city of Vancouver are on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples. Specifically the UBC Vancouver campus is on xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) land.\n\nThere are nearly 200 First Nations spread through BC, and many more across the continent.\n\nIt is essential to recognize Indigenous territories and Indigenous sovereignty, especially within the context of geography courses.\nTo learn more about the Indigenous people, culture, and languages where you live and around the world, check out native-land.ca.\n\n\n\n\n\nMap Source\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Do an Acknowledgement?\nA land acknowledgement is meant to convey a deep rooted cultural connection to the land and the historical and present day injustices and violence enacted on Indigenous communities through colonialism. For centuries, settler societies have perpetuated a genocide against Indigenous people across the globe. In many ways this genocide is still ongoing here in British Columbia and across Canada. There has been concerted effort by the government, religious organizations, and educational institutions to erase Indigenous culture and identity which as marginalized these communities in Canadian Society.\n\nAn acknowledgement is one small way to help with that, but it cannot be treated as a formality. It is a time to reflect and build understanding.\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\n\nTraditional and Ancestral Recognize by whom the lands were traditionally used and/or occupied and the cultures have been handed down from generation to generation. The area around UBC was used by many different people, including the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm, əl̓ilwətaɁɬ, and Skwxwú7mesh-ulh Nations. The map to the left shows the overlapping territories of these nations, along with others in the region.\nThese people are are part of a broader linguistic / cultural group of Coast Salish speaking people. The xʷməθkʷəy̓əm and əl̓ilwətaɁɬ speak dialects of Hul’q’umi’num’ / Halq’eméylem / hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓ and the Skwxwú7mesh-ulh speak Sḵwx̱wú7mesh sníchim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnceded: Refers to land that was not turned over to the government by a treaty or other agreement. Over 95% of the land in BC, and many lands elsewhere in the world were never ceded by treaty. Without treaties, these lands remain the sovereign territory of the First Nations that call them home. Yet at the same time, the lands have been claimed by Canada and these First Nations living on these lands lack a framework to express their sovereignty. This by no means absolves the Canadian government of their crimes where lands were “ceded” by treaty. Treaties were more frequently reached by coercion than negotiation. The RCMP was created specifically to force indigenous people off their lands by any means necessary."

    "text": "History and Scope of the Station\nThe UBC Climatological Station was established in 1957 at UBC Point Grey Campus west of the Agronomy Barn on Agronomy Road. By 1961 the UBC Climatological Station had achieved the necessary standards to be classed as an Ordinary Climatological Station by the Environment Canada Climatological Network (Hare and Thomas, 1979). In the early 1970s, campus development forced its relocation further south, to the Totem Research Station (Figure 2). The station is located 100m a.s.l. with an open exposure to the majority of the climatic elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Location of Totem Climate Station\n\n\n\nStandardization\nAny site of a climatological station must meet basic criteria before its data will be accepted by Environment Canada. For example, the surroundings must be reasonably flat, there should be no major obstacles to airflow, no significant obstruction to the horizon, no extraneous sources of heat, vapor or dust and the surface should consist of short grass. Similarly, the instrumentation must conform to Environment Canada standards. The data gathered from a climatological station are to be related to large-scale air mass and regional characteristics not the microclimate of the site. Insistence on these points assures users of site and instrument standardization so that different stations can be compared within expected limits of accuracy."

The table below (Table 1) lists the variables measured at the UBC Climatological Station. This is followed by discussion of some specific variables measured at the station and some example data from different time periods.\n\n\nTable 1: Automatic measurements recorded every 10 seconds at the UBC Climatological Station\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInstrument\nLevel\nUnits\n\n\n\n\nShort-wave Radiation\nPyranometer\n1 m height A-frame (incoming and outgoing)\nW m2\n\n\nLong-wave Radiation\nPyrgeometer\n1 m height A-frame (incoming and outgoing)\nW m2\n\n\nAir temperature\nThermistor\n1.3 m height\n°C\n\n\nHumidity\nThin-film capacitive sensor\n1.3 m height\n%\n\n\nSoil temperature\nThermocouples\n10, 20, and 40 cm depths\n°C\n\n\nWind speed / direction\nPropeller anemometer\n10m height\nm s-1\n\n\nSnow depth\nSonic ranging sensor\n1.3 m height\ncm\n\n\nPrecipitation\nTipping bucket rain gauge\n1 m height\nmm\n\n\n\n\n\nRadiation\nFigure 3 (a) shows a pyranometer, which is used to measure the short-wave (SW) radiation at the station. Shortwave radiation is also know as solar radiation, because it is the primary wavelength of radiation emitted from the Sun. The pyranometer contains a small black absorber disk inside a glass dome whose radiative properties allow only radiation with wavelengths (\\(\\mu\\)) between 0.3 and 3 \\(\\mu m\\) to pass through. As radiation reaches the absorber disk, it will warm up and create a temperature difference to the rest of the body of the instrument whose temperature varies only slowly. The difference can be directly related to short-wave receipt.\nFigure 3 (b) shows a pyrgeometer, which is used to measure the thermal radiation, also know as long-wave (LW) radiation. It works in a similar way as a pyranometer, except it measures wavelengths between 4.5 and 100 µm. Figure 3 (c) shows how sets of pyranometers and pyrgeometers, one of each pointing upward toward the sky and downward toward the ground, are used to measure both incoming and outgoing short-wave and long-wave radiation respectively. We’ll take a more in depth look at radiation in lab 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Pyranometer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Pyrgeometer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Typical radiation measurement setup\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Instrumentation used to measure radiation\n\n\n\n\nAir & Soil Temperature\nAir temperature and humidity are measured in a Stevenson screen Figure 4 designed to protect the instruments from liquid water (rain/snow) and shade them from solar radiation, but permit free air circulation.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Stevenson Screen\n\n\nSoil temperatures are measured using Copper/Constantan thermocouples. These are wires made up of two different metals that carry a small electrical signal. The transfer of electricity between the two metals is dependent upon temperature, and from that we can calculate temperature for whatever medium the thermocouple is in contact with.\n\nFigure 5 shows an example of air and soil temperature data collected at Totem field during the 2021 Heatdome.\n\nYou can move your cursor over the traces (lines) to see the values of the different variables.\nThink about how air and soil temperatures compare to one another in this example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Temperature data from Totem Field during the 2021 Heatdome.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecipitation\nRainfall is measured using a tipping bucket Figure 6 (b), which works by funneling precipitation into small seesaw-like counter Figure 6. The depth of new snowfall and the total depth of the snow lying on the ground was historically measured with a meter stick. It is now measured using an automated sonic snow depth sensor Figure 6 (c).\n\nLiquid water equivalent of the snow is typically estimated using a 10:1 ratio\n\n10 mm of snow ≈ 1 mm of rainfall\n\nHowever, this is just an average, and accuracy of this estimate can vary drastically depending on the type of snow.\n\nIn Vancouver, we typically get “wet, heavy snow” which has a much higher liquid water equivalent, with a ratio closer to 5:1. Using the standard 10:1 ratio for a typical Vancouver snowfall would underestimate liquid precipitation.\n“Powder”, the light, fluffy snow common in dry mountainous areas that makes for great skiing has a much lower liquid water equivalent, with a ratio closer to 20:1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Inside a Tipping bucket\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Tipping bucket\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Snow depth sensor\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Instrumentation used to measure precipitation (rain and snow).\n\n\n\nFigure 7 shows an example of precipitation data collected at Totem field during November 2021, when an Atmospheric River caused widespread flooding across the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Precipitation data from Totem Field during the 2021 Atmospheric River event.\n\n\n\n\n\nWind Speed\nWind speed (horizontal) and direction are measured on a prop vane anemometer Figure 8.

Short wave-radiation reaching a thermometer would be absorbed and warm it up.\nThe slatted walls still allow airflow through the screen to keep thermometers near air temperature. Otherwise, in a closed box, the interior temperature of the box would not correspond to air temperature anymore (decoupled).\n\n\n\nQuestion 3 [1 points]\nHow do air and soil temperatures compare to one another during the 2021 Heatdome event shown in Figure 5? Which variable (air or soil temperature at 10/20/40 cm) has the largest range on a daily basis? Which has the smallest range?\nAnswer:\n\nSoil temperatures are less variable than air temperatures (i.e., they’re buffered from extreme changes) on both. Soil temps also lag behind air temperatures and decrease with depth in the summer.\nThe air temperature range is greatest, up to 10 C / day during the heat dome - 5 cm soil T is &lt; 5 C/day, 40 cm barely changes on a daily basis.\n\nNote: (Extra context)\n\nIt takes much more energy to raise the temperature of a volume of soil than it does an equivalent volume of air.\n\n\n\nQuestion 4 [0.5 points]\nFill in the blank(s): indicate the words/phrases that complete the statement.\nUsing the standard 10:1 ratio for “Powder” snow in a dry mountainous region would ______ liquid precipitation.\nAnswer:\n\nOverestimate\n\nNote For TA\nDon’t need exact wording - accept synonymous answers.\n\n\nQuestion 5 [1 points]\nBased on Figure 9, do you think the wind data from the last few years at totem field is accurate?

Take screenshots of the climate normal graphs and include them in your answer.\nAnswer:\n\nAnswer will be dependent upon specific location they select, but …\nNunavut will be Much colder and drier - with only summer months above freezing\nQuebec will be colder in winter and warmer in summer (unless they pick a station in northern Quebec). Precipitation will be more evenly distributed through the year, but overall lower than Vancouver."

    "text": "The Ideal Gas Law\nYou may recall from a high school chemistry class, the Ideal Gas Law (Equation 1) can be used to describe the state of some a gas as a function of pressure (\\(P\\)), volume (\\(V\\)), temperature (\\(T\\)), and the amount of the gas (\\(n\\)) in moles; with \\(R\\) being the ideal gas constant (see Table 1). The amount in moles of a given gas can be defined as \\(n = \\frac{m}{M}\\), where \\(m\\) is the mass of the substance (in kg or g) and \\(M\\) is the Molar mass (in kg mol-1 or g mol-1) respectively. The molar mass of water (in g mol-1) is listed in Table 1. The Ideal Gas Law generally applies to water vapor as it does other gasses and can be used to help explain some important relationships.\n\\[\nPV=nRT\n\\tag{1}\\]\nTwo key metrics we use to describe atmospheric moisture in meteorology are:\n\nVapor density: \\(\\rho_v\\)\n\n\nThis metric quantifies the density of water vapor within a parcel of air and is typically given in g m-3\n\nIt describes mass of H2O vapor (in grams) per unit volume (cubic meter) of air, i.e. \\(\\frac{m_{H2O}}{V}\\).\n\n\n\nVapor pressure: \\(P_v\\)\n\n\nThis metric quantifies the partial pressure exerted by the water vapor in a parcel of air and is typically given in kPa.\n\nThe pressure exerted by the water vapor in the atmosphere, is only a small portion of the total pressure exerted by the atmosphere. The pressure of the various gasses is proportional composition of gasses in the atmosphere (see Table 2)\n\n\nWe can redefine the ideal gas law in terms of \\(\\rho_v\\) and \\(P_v\\) as Equation 2 to make our calculations easier:\n\\[\n\\rho_v = \\frac{P_vM}{RT}\n\\tag{2}\\]"

    "section": "Saturation",
    "text": "Saturation\nUnder the pressures and temperature conditions experienced on Earth the atmosphere can only hold a small amount of water vapor before it becomes saturated. We add an asterisk to \\(\\rho_v^*\\) and \\(P_v^*\\) to denote saturation vapor density and saturation vapor pressure respectively. Once the atmosphere reaches saturation point, H2O vapor in the air will begin to condense into its liquid form.\nDetermining exact value of \\(\\rho_v^*\\) and \\(P_v^*\\) for a specific value of \\(T\\) isn’t a straightforward calculation. This is because we need to consider the latent heat of vaporization (recall this term for lecture). When water changes phase, it adds (condensation/freezing) or removes (evaporation/melting) a massive amount of energy from its surrounding environment. Calculating \\(\\rho_v^*\\) and \\(P_v^*\\) exactly involves using some calculus to evaluate a differential equation known as the Clausius–Clapeyron relation. But don’t worry, we’re not going to make you do any calculus here. Empirically derived relationships have been derived to help simplify the calculations. On such relationship, is known as the Buck equation (Equation 3). Note: this empirical equation requires \\(T\\) to be in \\(^\\circ C\\), instead of \\(K\\), which is different from most from many others. The ideal gas law Equation 1 and it’s variant Equation 2 require temperature to be in K.\n\\[\nP_v^*=0.61121e^{(18.678-\\frac{T}{234.5})(\\frac{T}{257.14+T})}\n\\tag{3}\\]\nBy evaluating Equation 3, we can come up with an accurate approximation for \\(P_v^*\\) to a high degree of accuracy (\\(\\pm\\) 0.08%) within the ranges of temperatures and pressures typically observed on Earths surface. We can then plug the result into Equation 2 to solve for \\(\\rho_v\\). Remembering to convert our temperature values to K in order to evaluate this variant of the ideal gas law. The R code shown in Example 1 shows how you could perform these calculations in programmatically. Figure 1 shows the output of Equation 3, i.e., how \\(P_v\\) varies with \\(T\\) for selected temperatures. Figure 2 shows the output of Equation 2 for given values of \\(T\\) and \\(P_v\\).\n\nExample 1 Functions to evaluate the Buck Equation and Ideal Gas Law. Functions are pieces of code that can be defined once an run numerous times. They make performing calculations that need to be repeated much easier. Functions may take one or more inputs in parentheses (). They and will evaluate the instructions contained between the curly brackets {}.

    "text": "Humidity\nThere are other ways of expressing the amount of moisture in the atmosphere; each has particular usefulness in certain applications. For example, relative humidity (RH); it is a given as a percentage (0-100%) and is the most commonly reported metric for humidity. When \\(RH = 100%\\), it indicates the atmosphere is saturated; when \\(RH &lt; 100%\\), it indicates the atmosphere is not saturated. Relative humidity is the ratio of \\(/rho_v\\) for a given parcel of air at a certain \\(T\\) relative to the maximum possible \\(\\rho_v^*\\) the parcel of air could have at that \\(T\\), as shown in Equation 4.\n\\[\nRH = \\frac{\\rho_v}{\\rho_v^*}\n\\tag{4}\\]\nNote: if you have a parcel with a known \\(\\rho_v\\) and a known \\(T\\), you can use Figure 2 to lookup the value of \\(\\rho_v^*\\) to evaluate Equation 4. Alternatively - you could also evaluate Equation 3 and Equation 2 to get \\(\\rho_v^*\\) and then evaluate Equation 4. This metric is useful because it can convey the relative saturation of the atmosphere without us having to know the absolute values. However, it can also be deceptive, because the two air parcels (one at 0 \\(^{\\circ}\\) C and one at 20 \\(^{\\circ}\\) C) that both have \\(RH = 100%\\) will contain significantly different amounts of water vapor in absolute terms.\nThe other commonly reported metric in every-day life is the dewpoint (\\(T_d\\)). This is the air temperature at which a parcel of air with a given \\(\\rho_v\\) would be saturated. If you have a parcel of air with known \\(\\rho_v\\), the value of \\(T\\) that corresponds to \\(\\rho_v\\) in Figure 2 would be it’s dewpoint. This metric is useful because it quantifies the absolute moisture content of a parcel of air (unlike \\(RH\\)). However - two parcels of air can have the same \\(T_d\\) while having drastically different air temperatures. Both \\(RH\\) and \\(T_d\\) are limited (in different ways) because they don’t convey the full picture; but they are still useful in day-to-day life as they are relatively easy to understand."

    "text": "Measuring Atmospheric Humidity\nA common and simple type of instrument used to measure humidity is the psychrometer (Figure 3). There are two variants of this instrument, but they have the same key components. They consist of a pair of a ventilated pair of thermometers, one of which has a wetted wick covering the bulb of the thermometer. The wet-bulb is cooled by evaporation to a value known as the “wet-bulb temperature” (\\(T_w\\)). If we have a measurement of both \\(T\\) (aka “dry-bulb” temperature) and \\(T_w\\) (aka “wet-bulb” temperature) we can calculate \\(\\rho_v\\) using Equation 7; where \\(\\rho_{vw}^*\\) is the saturation vapor density at \\(T_w\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) is the psychrometric constant (see Table 1). The value of \\(\\rho_{vw}^*\\) can be found by looking up \\(T_w\\) in Figure 2, or by plugging \\(T_w\\) into Equation 3 and Equation 2.\nWet bulb temperature (\\(T_w\\)) is also a useful metric, because it gives us the minimum temperature to which an object can be cooled via evaporation, under different temperature and humidity conditions. This has important ramifications for public safety; humans cannot survive exposure to \\(T_w &gt; 35 ^{\\circ} C\\) for more than six hours.

The students must use their own vapor densities and offer plausible explanations. e.g. dry or rainy weather outside, people breathing out moisture inside, heating dries out building & etc. a warm room will tend to reduce \\(\\rho_v\\) a little. - 1pt\nExpect inside and outside vapor densities to be more different; inside will likely be larger if its a cool day, if outdoor temp is close to room temp then they’ll be more similar, if measurements occur on hot day and the lab were air conditioned then we’d see expect outdoors to have the larger VPD. The students must use their own VPD and offer plausible explanations. e.g. cool weather outside vs heated conditions inside resulting in different \\(P_v^*\\) - 1pt\n\\(T_d \\leq T_w \\leq T\\) - .25pt\n\nExtra context: (not required for credit) If the atmosphere is saturated (ie. \\(RH = 100%\\)) then the three values will be equal - otherwise, \\(T_w\\) will be between \\(T_d\\) and \\(T\\)"

This convention is used because \\(R_n\\) is regarded as an input to the system. Positive \\(R_n\\) indicates a surplus of energy at the surface, which must be balanced by the other terms in Equation 1. Negative \\(R_n\\) indicates a deficit of energy at the surface, which must be balanced by the other terms in Equation 1.\nPositive values of the sensible flux heat density, \\(H_S\\), the latent heat flux density, \\(H_L\\), and the soil heat flux density, \\(H_G\\), mean that energy is flowing out of the system (i.e., away from the surface); negative values mean the opposite (i.e., towards the surface). This is because \\(H_S\\), \\(H_L\\) and \\(H_G\\) are regarded as outputs from the system. Positive values of the energy storage, \\(\\Delta S\\), within the system, mean that the system is accumulating energy; negative values mean that the system is losing energy. Energy may be stored in a number of ways, such as sensible and latent heat in the canopy or as chemical energy (photosynthesis) in the plants.\n\nNote: energy storage as a result of horizontal energy transport (advection) can occur in heterogeneous systems near near borders/boundaries. This is more difficult to account for and why Equation 1 only works well for homogenous ecosystems.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Schematic of the energy balance of a forested ecosystem, during sunny daytime conditions.

    "section": "Surface-Atmosphere Fluxes",
    "text": "Surface-Atmosphere Fluxes\nThe sensible and latent and heat flux density terms in Equation 1 are difficult to determine. As we discussed in lecture, one way to estimate ecosystem-atmosphere fluxes is to use the gradient method. This technique is similar to using Fourier’s Law for calculate soil heat fluxes. For example, if we know the eddy diffusivity (\\(K\\)) and heat capacity air (\\(C_a \\approx\\) 1200 J m-3 K-1), we can use the gradient method to estimate sensible heat flux (\\(H_S\\)) from observations of air temperatures (\\(T\\)) at two heights (\\(z\\)).\n\\[\nH_s = -K C_a \\frac{T_2 - T_1}{z_2 - z_1}\n\\tag{3}\\]\nExample 2 shows how you could calculate \\(H_S\\) over a grassland ecosystem (\\(K = 0.35 \\ m^{2} s^{-1}\\)).\n\nExample 2  \n\nT1 = 11 #deg C\nT2 = 12 #deg C\nZ1 = 0.5 #m\nZ2 = 4.75 #m\nk = 0.35 #m2 s-1\nC_a = 1200 #J m-3 K-1\nH_S = -k*C_a*(T2-T1)/(Z2-Z1)\n\nWith \\(T\\) = 11\\(^{\\circ}C\\) at 0.5 m and \\(T\\) = 12\\(^{\\circ}C\\) at 4.75 m; then \\(H_S\\) would be -98.8 W m-2. Note, when \\(H_S\\) is negative, it indicates sensible heat is moving into the surface from the atmosphere.\n\n\nEddy Covariance\nOften, we don’t always the prior knowledge of the the coefficients needed to evaluate the gradient method; for example \\(K\\) varies as a function wind speed, stability, and and site-specific factors (e.g., surface roughness). Instead, we often measure ecosystem-atmosphere fluxes density directly using the eddy covariance (EC) technique. An EC system is shown in Figure 3.\n\n\nUnderstanding the full theory behind how EC works is beyond the scope of this course, but in short: a sonic anemometer can track fluctuations in vertical wind speeds over time. Paired with observations of temperature and water vapor fluctuations over time, we can calculate \\(H_S\\) and \\(H_L\\). The EC method is useful because it allows us to directly observe components of an ecosystem’s energy balance. However, this technique generally requires a homogeneous ecosystems to yield reasonable results. For example, if sensors are placed near a sharp boundary between two different ecosystems, it can be difficult to determine the actual value for either system, because the observed value is a conflation of fluxes from both ecosystems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Example of an eddy covariance (EC) system, showing a sonic anemometer and an infrared gas analyzer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaporation Rates\nThe energy balance is often used to estimate the evaporative water loss from ecosystems such as crops, forests, and water bodies. The latent heat flux density \\(H_L\\) is the energy used to evaporate water in the stomata (transpiration) and evaporate water in the soil near the soil surface (evaporation from the soil). The sum of transpiration and evaporation from the soil is evapotranspiration.\n\n\nThe latent heat flux density \\(H_L\\) can be used to calculate the evapotranspiration rate (\\(E\\)) from an open water surface (e.g., a pond). Equation 4 gives \\(E\\) in m s-1, though we typically convert it to mm h-1. Here, \\(\\rho_{H_2O}\\) is the density of water (1000 kg m-3) and \\(L_v\\) is the latent heat of vaporization of water. As you’ve seen in lecture, the latent heat of vaporization is not a constant value; it varies as a function of air temperature. Figure 4 gives the latent heat of vaporization for selected temperatures.\n\\[\nE = \\frac{H_L}{L_v*\\rho_{H_2O}}\n\\tag{4}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Latent heat of vaporization in kJ kg-1 at selected temperatures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet Ecosystem Productivity\nNet ecosystem productivity (NEP) is the primary component of the C balance in most terrestrial ecosystems. It is defined as the difference between ecosystem scale photosynthesis and respiration:\n\\[\nNEP=GPP-ER\n\\tag{5}\\]\nThe sign convention is opposite of what meteorologists often use. Positive (+) indicates accumulation of C in the ecosystem, negative (-) indicates loss of C from the ecosystem. Gross primary productivity (GPP) is the total photosynthetic uptake of carbon dioxide \\(CO_2\\) by plants in an ecosystem. Ecosystem respiration (ER) is the total respiration of \\(CO_2\\) by living organisms in an ecosystem.\nWe cannot directly measure NEP with eddy covariance, but we can approximate it by measuring Net ecosystem exchange (NEE). This is net flux of \\(CO_2\\) observed between an ecosystem and the atmosphere. It is frequently treated as the inverse of NEP: i.e., \\(NEP \\approx -NEE\\). The sign convention is opposite of NEP because NEE was defined by atmospheric scientists; positive (+) indicates accumulation of C in the atmosphere, negative (-) uptake of C from the atmosphere. At small spatial scales and over short timescales this assumption is reasonable, but strictly speaking, NEE and NEP are not equivalent. Over larger/longer scales they diverge because some \\(CO_2\\) can be dissolved in ground water and transported into or out of an ecosystem. Transport of \\(CO_2\\) in ground water cannot be measured via EC methods, so further data is needed to get a full accounting of an ecosystem’s carbon budget.\n\nIf you are curios to learn a bit more, you can find a more detailed explanation here."

This allows for relative comparisons between values:\n\ne.ge., 100 K is “twice as hot” as 50 K\n\n\n\\(^{\\circ} C\\) is the freezing point of fresh water at 1 atm (mean atmospheric pressure at sea level).\n\nCelsius is on an interval scale &gt; it has an arbitrary zero value and can take positive or negative values.

The World Meteorological Organization published the International Cloud Atlas in 1956, based on Howard’s classification scheme.\nCirrus clouds are high clouds with a feathery appearance that are composed of ice crystals. Cumulus clouds are dome-shaped, bunched clouds, with a flat base and billowy upper portions that often rise high in the troposphere; that is, they show strong vertical development. Stratus clouds are low, flat sheets of clouds."
