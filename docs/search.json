    "text": "Measuring Atmospheric Humidity\nThe most common type of instrument used to measure humidity is the psychrometer (Figure 3). This instrument consists simply of a pair of thermometers, one of which has a wetted wick enclosing the sensor. The wet-bulb is cooled by evaporation to a temperature that depends on the atmospheric vapor density.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Diagram of a sling psychrometer\n\n\nThe water vapor density \\(\\rho_v\\) (aka. absolute humidity) can be calculated from measurements of wet-bulb temperature (\\(T_b\\)) and dry-bulb temperature (\\(T\\)) using the relationship:\n\\[\n\\rho_v = \\rho^*_{vw}(T_w) - \\gamma(T-T_w)\n\\tag{1}\\]\nThese and other symbols in this exercise are defined in Table 1.\nOther ways of expressing the amount of moisture are used and each has particular usefulness in certain applications. The total amount of water that the atmosphere can hold without condensation depends only on temperature. This quantity, called the saturation vapor density \\(\\rho^*_v(T)\\), is given for a range of temperatures in Figure 1. The ratio of actual vapor density to the maximum possible (i.e. the saturation vapor density) when expressed as a percentage is called the relative humidity:\n\\[\nRH = \\frac{\\rho_v}{\\rho^*_v(T)}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nFor some calculations of evaporation rate, the difference between the maximum and the actual vapor density is useful. This is called the vapor density deficit:\n\\[\nVDD = \\rho^*_v(T) - \\rho_v\n\\tag{3}\\]\nWe may express the water vapor content of air by finding the temperature to which a parcel of air could be cooled at constant atmospheric pressure before condensation commences. This temperature is called the dew point temperature \\(T_d\\). Note: that for a saturated parcel the dewpoint temperature is the temperature of the parcel. For any water vapor density, \\(T_d\\) can be found by using Figure 1 in reverse. For example, air with a vapor density of 7.8 g m-3 has a \\(T_d\\) of 7°C.\nWater vapor content of the air can be expressed in terms of the partial pressure exerted by the water vapor, or water vapor pressure, \\(e\\). This is related to vapor density by the gas law as follows:\n\\[\ne = \\rho_v R_v T\n\\tag{4}\\]\nWhere R_v is the gas constant for water vapor (see Table 1) and \\(T\\) is the absolute temperature (K). Using units of g m-3 for \\(\\rho_v(T)\\) results in units of kPa (kilopascals) for \\(e\\).\nSaturation vapor pressure, \\(e*(T)\\): Consider a parcel at temperature \\(T\\). Unless the parcel is currently saturated, the parcel could hold more water vapor than it currently does. The partial pressure exerted by the water vapor is given by \\(e\\), whereas the partial pressure that would be exerted by the water vapor if the parcel were saturated, is \\(e*\\), which is a function of temperature: i.e., \\(e*(T)\\). (Units: kPa).\nVapor pressure deficit, VPD: Vapor pressure deficit represents the difference between the actual and saturation vapor pressures of a parcel at temperature T:\n\\[\nVPD = e*(T) - e\n\\tag{5}\\]\n\nNote: that the smaller the VPD, the closer the parcel is to saturation.

Use the equilibrium values for further calculations.\nReturn to the laboratory, re-wet the wick and re-wind the psychrometer. Repeat the measurements of wet- and dry-bulb temperature.

The sample warmed to room temperature allowing its pressure to remain constant. What happens to its volume? Which of the measures of humidity (\\(\\rho_v(T)\\), \\(e\\), \\(RH\\), \\(VDD\\) and \\(T_d\\)) will be the same when determined on this warmed sample as would be obtained by measurement with a psychrometer outdoors and how would each measure of humidity differ? Hint: remember pressure is constant, but temperature, and therefore volume, changes.\n\n\nQuestion 3 (1 points)\nWere your measured vapor densities indoors and outdoors equal? Is this reasonable? Explain why. ### Question 4 (1 points)\n\n\nQuestion 5 (1 points)\nA high-precision method for measuring water vapor content of the air uses a dew-point hygrometer. In this instrument a mirror is cooled until condensation causes fogging on the mirror and this is detected by a photodetector that records the scattering of a beam of light shining on the mirror. At that time, the temperature of the mirror is recorded. What temperature would be recorded if the air vapor pressure is 1.60 kPa? ### Question 6 (1 points)\n\n\nQuestion 7 (2 points)\nA cool winter Canadian air mass with a temperature of -4°C and a relative humidity of 91% meets a warm air mass sweeping northward from Texas with a temperature of 17°C and a relative humidity of 17%. In the mixing process will the southern border of the Canadian air gain or lose water vapor content? Explain."

By 1961 the UBC Climatological Station had achieved the necessary standards to be classed as an Ordinary Climatological Station by the Environment Canada Climatological Network (Hare and Thomas, 1979). In the early 1970s, campus development forced its relocation further south, to the Totem Research Station (Figure 2). The station is located 100m a.s.l. with an open exposure to the majority of the climatic elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Location of Totem Climate Station\n\n\n\nStandardization\nAny site of a climatological station must meet basic criteria before its data will be accepted by Environment Canada. For example, the surroundings must be reasonably flat, there should be no major obstacles to airflow, no significant obstruction to the horizon, no extraneous sources of heat, vapor or dust and the surface should consist of short grass. Similarly, the instrumentation must conform to Environment Canada standards. The data gathered from a climatological station are to be related to large-scale air mass and regional characteristics not the microclimate of the site. Insistence on these points assures users of site and instrument standardization so that different stations can be compared within expected limits of accuracy."

Shortwave radiation is also know as solar radiation, because it is the primary wavelength of radiation emitted from the Sun. The pyranometer contains a small black absorber disk inside a glass dome whose radiative properties allow only radiation with wavelengths (\\(\\mu\\)) between 0.3 and 3 \\(\\mu m\\) to pass through. As radiation reaches the absorber disk, it will warm up and create a temperature difference to the rest of the body of the instrument whose temperature varies only slowly. The difference can be directly related to short-wave receipt.\nFigure 3 (b) shows a pyrgeometer, which is used to measure the thermal radiation, also know as long-wave (LW) radiation. It works in a similar way as a pyranometer, except it measures wavelengths between 4.5 and 100 µm. Figure 3 (c) shows how sets of pyranometers and pyrgeometers, one of each pointing upward toward the sky and downward toward the ground, are used to measure both incoming and outgoing short-wave and long-wave radiation respectively. We’ll take a more in depth look at radiation in lab 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Pyranometer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Pyrgeometer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Typical radiation measurement setup\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Instrumentation used to measure radiation\n\n\n\n\nAir & Soil Temperature\nAir temperature and humidity are measured in a Stevenson screen Figure 4 designed to protect the instruments from liquid water (rain/snow) and shade them from solar radiation, but permit free air circulation.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Stevenson Screen\n\n\nSoil temperatures are measured using Copper/Constantan thermocouples. These are wires made up of two different metals that carry a small electrical signal. The transfer of electricity between the two metals is dependent upon temperature, and from that we can calculate temperature for whatever medium the thermocouple is in contact with.\n\nFigure 5 shows an example of air and soil temperature data collected at Totem field during the 2021 Heatdome.\n\nYou can move your cursor over the traces (lines) to see the values of the different variables.\nThink about how air and soil temperatures compare to one another in this example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Temperature data from Totem Field during the 2021 Heatdome.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecipitation\nRainfall is measured using a tipping bucket Figure 6 (b), which works by funneling precipitation into small seesaw-like counter Figure 6. The depth of new snowfall and the total depth of the snow lying on the ground was historically measured with a meter stick. It is now measured using an automated sonic snow depth sensor Figure 6 (c).\n\nLiquid water equivalent of the snow is typically estimated using a 10:1 ratio\n\n10 mm of snow ≈ 1 mm of rainfall\n\nHowever, this is just an average, and accuracy of this estimate can vary drastically depending on the type of snow.\n\nIn Vancouver, we typically get “wet, heavy snow” which has a much higher liquid water equivalent, with a ratio closer to 5:1. Using the standard 10:1 ratio for a typical Vancouver snowfall would underestimate liquid precipitation.\n“Powder”, the light, fluffy snow common in dry mountainous areas that makes for great skiing has a much lower liquid water equivalent, with a ratio closer to 20:1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Inside a Tipping bucket\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Tipping bucket\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Snow depth sensor\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Instrumentation used to measure precipitation (rain and snow).\n\n\n\nFigure 7 shows an example of precipitation data collected at Totem field during November 2021, when an Atmospheric River caused widespread flooding across the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Precipitation data from Totem Field during the 2021 Atmospheric River event.\n\n\n\n\n\nWind Speed\nWind speed (horizontal) and direction are measured on a prop vane anemometer Figure 8.

For centuries, settler societies have perpetuated a genocide against Indigenous people across the globe. In many ways this genocide is still ongoing here in British Columbia and across Canada. There has been concerted effort by the government, religious organizations, and educational institutions to erase Indigenous culture and identity which as marginalized these communities in Canadian Society.\n\nAn acknowledgement is one small way to help with that, but it cannot be treated as a formality. It is a time to reflect and build understanding.\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\n\nTraditional and Ancestral Recognize by whom the lands were traditionally used and/or occupied and the cultures have been handed down from generation to generation.

Yet at the same time, the lands have been claimed by Canada and these First Nations living on these lands lack a framework to express their sovereignty. This by no means absolves the Canadian government of their crimes where lands were “ceded” by treaty. Treaties were more frequently reached by coercion than negotiation. The RCMP was created specifically to force indigenous people off their lands by any means necessary."

The solar beam spreads out (dissipates) on the (approximately) 150 million km journey from the sun to the Earth. Satellite measurements indicate that the mean radiative flux density a the top of the atmosphere is 1361 W m-2; this value is known as the solar constant \\(I_0\\). Knowing the value of the solar constant, we can do some calculations to deduce the total radiative flux of the sun in W. The calculation is shown in the example below in Example 1 using R code. See the output at the bottom for the approximate value. Note: This is just an illustrative example to expose you to programmatic calculations using R. You do not need to know/learn R for this course.\nThe earth has a slightly eccentric orbit - it is elliptical (slightly oval shaped) and off center. This means that the distance between the earth and the sun vary slightly. The Earth is closest to the sun (147 million km) on the perihelion which occurs in early January and it is farthest from the sun (152 million km) on the aphelion in early July Figure 4 (a). Consequently, the true flux density of the solar beam at the top of Earth’s atmosphere will deviate slightly from the solar constant over the course of the year.\n\nExample 1  \n\n# Deriving solar radiative output from the solar constant.\n# Defining our variables\nSolar_Constant = 1361\n\n# Note - when writing code, we can use the \"e\" character as shorthand for scientific notation\n# 1.5e11 = 1.5 x 10^11\nRadius_of_Orbit = 1.5e11\n\n# Calculate the total area over which the solar beam is spread at the average distance between the earth and the sun\n# Area = 4πr2\nArea = 4*pi*Radius_of_Orbit**2\n\n# To convert the flux density (Solar_Constant) to a total Flux we multiply by area\nSolar_Flux = Solar_Constant*Area\n\n# This function formats a text (string) output the \"%s\" values are replaced with the variable(s) listed after the string\nOutput &lt;- sprintf('Radiative Output (Flux) of the sun %s W',Solar_Flux)\n\n# This function prints us a cleanly formatted output\nwriteLines(Output)\n\nRadiative Output (Flux) of the sun 3.84813684138214e+26 W\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Simplified diagram showing the seasonal changes in the Sun-Earth geometry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Diagram showing the spreading of the solar beam with changing latitude\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Some key aspects of the geometry of the Sun-Earth system."

    "text": "Balancing the Budget\nFollowing equation Equation 1. A portion of incoming short-wave radiation (\\(SW \\downarrow\\)) that hits Earth is reflected by the surface back towards the sky as outgoing short-wave radiation (\\(SW \\uparrow\\)). We can define the term albedo to describe reflected short wave radiation (\\(\\alpha_SW\\)):\n\\[\nalbedo = \\alpha_{SW} = \\frac{\\uparrow SW}{\\downarrow SW}\n\\tag{4}\\]\nFollowing Equation 1, the earth can also absorb shortwave radiation (\\(a_{SW}\\)). The earth (as a whole) also does not transmit short-wave radiation (\\(\\tau_{SW}\\)). However objects on or near its surface, such as leaves can Figure 1. When dealing with an opaque object such as a the surface of the earth, we can define absorption as Equation 5, but when dealing with transparent objects such as leaves or water, we must define absorption as Equation 6:\n\\[\na_{\\lambda} = 1  - \\alpha_{\\lambda}\n\\tag{5}\\]\n\\[\na_{\\lambda} = 1  - \\alpha_{\\lambda} - \\tau_{\\lambda}\n\\tag{6}\\]\n\nNote Equation 1 and Equation 6 are equivalent to one another.\nNote you can calculate \\(\\tau\\) using the same approach as in Equation 4, you would just use transmitted \\(SW\\) in the numerator instead of reflected \\(SW\\)\n\nFollowing Equation 5, any short-wave radiation that is not reelected by the Earth’s surface, will be absorbed. When short-wave radiation is absorbed, the energy is “transformed” from one form to another. Some of the energy goes towards phase changes of water, some of it goes into chemical reactions (e.g., photosynthesis), and a large portion of it is re-emitted as outgoing long-wave radiation (\\(LW\\uparrow\\)), aka. thermal radiation. Following\nCombining these Net All-Wave Radiation (\\(R_n\\)), as defined in Equation 7, is the sum of all incoming (\\(\\downarrow\\)) and outgoing (\\(\\uparrow\\)) short-wave (\\(SW\\)) and long-wave (\\(LW\\)) radiation. Net radiation can tell us how much energy is entering (positive) or leaving (negative) the site at any given time. If net \\((R_n)\\) is a large positive number, that indicates significant energy input, which would cause the land surface at the site to warm up. Conversely, if \\((R_n)\\) is negative, that means the site is loosing energy (cooling off).\n\\[\nR_n = (SW \\downarrow - SW \\uparrow) + (LW \\downarrow - LW \\uparrow)\n\\tag{7}\\]\nThe all-wave budget could also be considered to consist of a net short-wave budget, \\(SW* = SW\\downarrow - SW\\uparrow\\) and a long-wave budget \\(SW* = SW\\downarrow - SW\\uparrow\\) , i.e. \\(R_n = SW* + LW*\\). The sign convention adopted here is that individual fluxes have no sign (i.e., always positive) but net fluxes (those with an asterisk) are positive if they are a net energy gain for the surface, and negative if they are a net energy loss."

It implies that in the 8-11 micrometer longwave (terrestrial) part of the radiation spectrum where there are no gases that absorb outgoing longwave radiation from the earth/atmosphere. Therefore this radiation is free to escape to space through these wavelengths. If this wasn’t the case, then the earth would continue to heat up over time.
