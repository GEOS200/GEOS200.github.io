**Turbulent flow**: irregular streamlines

* Mixing is very efficient and occurs mainly by convection

## Turbulence

Turbulence is a feature of flows, not fluids. 

* Turbulent flows are very efficient in equalizing temperature and concentration gradients: 

  + In the Atmosphere, turbulent flows are 10<sup>5</sup> times more efficient than molecular diffusion


## Eddies

Coherent parts within the flow which have the same properties. 

* Eddies exist in a wide range of different sizes

  + “Big whorls have little whorls which feed on their velocity, and little whorls have lesser whorls, and so on to viscosity.” 
    - Richardson, 1922

## Eddies

Coherent parts within the flow which have the same properties. 

* Eddies exist in a wide range of different sizes

* The smallest eddies dissipate to heat

## Forced (Mechanical) Convection

Requires a continual supply of kinetic energy from the flow. It comes from the mean wind speed.

* Wind is driven by pressure/temperature gradients at larger scales (we'll discuss this later)

## Forced (Mechanical) Convection


We can have three different scenarios that create turbulence mechanically


![](images/Lecture14/12_2.png)




## Free (Thermal) Convection



Surface heating differences → density differences → buoyancy differences → convection.


![](images/Lecture1/18_3.png)



## Free (Thermal) Convection


Buoyant parcels are often semi-organized into ‘plumes’; rising thermals form convection cells.

## Reynolds Decomposition


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}



Turbulent properties appear chaotic, but can be analyzed by deconstructing them into two parts: 

* The time mean (e.g., $\bar{a}$)
* The instantaneous deviation from the mean (e.g., $a^{\prime}$)

This is called Reynolds’ decomposition

## Flux Gradient Method

For sensible heat flux we can write: 

{{< include ..\_Equations\Flux-Gradient-Method-Sensible-Heat.qmd >}}

* $K$ is the eddy diffusivity (m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) and $C_a$ is the heat capacity of dry air

* Note the similarity to Fouriers Law!

## Eddy Diffusivity

$K$ varies as a function of the intensity of the turbulence and therefore varies

* Wind speed > $K$ will increase as a function of wind speed
* Stability > $K$ is greater for unstable conditions
* Surface roughness
  + All else equal $K$ will be higher for a rougher surface
    - $K_{forest} > K_{water}$


## Flux Gradient Method

Similar equations can be written for the fluxes of H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, etc.

{{< include ..\_Equations\Flux-Gradient-Method-Generic.qmd >}}

* Here; $F$ is the flux of some property ($f$), and $C^*$ is a "unit conversion constant" 
* **Note**: @eq-Flux-Gradient-Method-Generic is for example only, you won't be asked to evaluate it
  * You *will* be asked to evaluate @eq-Flux-Gradient-Method-Sensible-Heat

## Convective Transport 


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

* Transport is accomplished because each eddy has a vertical velocity ($w$) and a concentrations ($c$)

  + $w$ wets the rate and direction of transport of various atmospheric properties ($T$, $\rho_v$, etc.)

## Convective Transport

The instantaneous flux density is the product of $w^{\prime}$ and $c^{\prime}$. 

* The average flux density is found by counting all the instantaneous products (w’ and c’) summing them, and averaging over the time period: 

![](images/Lecture14/12_3.png)


## Reynolds Notation {.smaller}


A flux density is the average of all the instantaneous products of the vertical speeds of the eddies and the properties they carry:  


{{< include ..\_Equations\Flux.qmd >}}

* $w^{\prime}$ and $c^{\prime}$ are the instantaneous vertical wind velocity and concentration of an entity 
  + The concentrations must be measured within about 30 cm of where w is measured

* These multiplications must be made typically 20 times each second and averaged over larger time intervals (usually 30 minutes). 
  + This means we must do 36,000 multiplications per 30 minutes!



## Eddy Covariance Method

This is called the eddy covariance method because the expression on the right @eq-Flux is called the covariance of $w^{\prime}$ and $c^{\prime}$


* For the case of sensible heat flux density we write:

{{< include ..\_Equations\Flux-Sensible-Heat.qmd >}}

* Where $C_a$ is the heat capacity of air (1200 J m<sup>-3</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>)



## Eddy Covariance Systems

## Latent Heat Flux Density

For many ecosystems, with a sufficient moisture supply latent heat flux $H_L$ will exceed sensible heat flux $H_S$.

::::{.columns}
:::{column width="50%"}

* $H_L$ is equivalent evapotranspiration from the ecosystem (when $H_L > 0$ W m<sup>-2</sup>):
  * Evaporation (from surfaces) + transpiration (from plants)

## Take home points {.smaller}


* Measurement of convective exchange is more difficult compared to conduction / diffusion.
* Fluid flow can be laminar or turbulent.
* Eddies are coherent parts of the flow that show homogeneous properties.
* Mechanical and thermal convection create eddies (turbulence).
* We can use Reynold’s notation to separate a signal into a turbulent and a mean part.
* Direct measurement using eddy covariance method is possible - but requires sophisticated and expensive instrumentation and more tedious data analysis.
