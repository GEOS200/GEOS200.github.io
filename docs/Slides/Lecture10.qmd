## Heat Conduction

![Thawing of permafrost is a slow process; involves conduction of heat into the subsurface from the surface](images/Lecture10/1_0.jpg)


## Learning Objectives

* Describe the process of heat conduction & explain how we can predict soil warming
* Understand how soil temperatures react to solar heating and how they change over time
* Define the term thermal admittance and its relationship with soil surface temperature
* Understand the concept of heat sharing (between soil and the atmosphere) 


## Recall: Heat Capacity of Compound Substances 


The heat capacity of a mixture of substances can be calculated from the heat capacity and volume fraction of each component. For soil:

{{< include ../_Equations/Heat-Capacity-Soil.qmd >}}


* $\theta$ is the volume fraction of mineral (m), organic matter (o), water (w) and air (a)
  * *Note*: $C_a$ is very small relative to the other values of C


## Test your knowledge (iClicker)

How does the heat capacity of the soil change as a function of soil moisture?

* A Linearly
* B Exponentially
* C It doesn’t vary with soil moisture


## Heat Capacity of Soils


![Porosity & saturation are the a dominant controls, mineral vs. organic is secondary](images/Lecture9/HeatCapacityOfSoil.png)


## Heat conduction

The process of heat transfer in a material medium in which molecular kinetic energy is passed from molecule to molecule. 

* Heat conduction is most effective in solids, but still occurs in liquids and gases
* Mass motion (convection) is not involved

![](images/Lecture10/Conduction.png){width=75%}





## Fourier’s Law

* Heat flux density ($H_G$) is proportional to the temperature gradient and the thermal conductivity $k$:

{{< include ../_Equations/Fouriers-Law.qmd >}}

* where $\frac{T_2 – T_1}{z_2 – z_1}$ is the temperature gradient 
* We use z for distance because we are interested in vertical heat flow in the soil

Again- the sign helps us with the directionality of the flux (i.e. a convention) – toward the surface is positive for non-radiational fluxes……

* The thermal conductivity $k$ is a measure of a materials ability to conduct heat
* For a mixture, it depends on the conductivity and proportion of the components of the mixture

fig <- fig %>% add_trace(x = ~X, y = ~OrganicSoil, name = 'Organic Soil',type = "scatter", mode = "lines+markers")

fig <- fig %>% add_trace(x = ~X, y = ~MineralSoil, name = 'Mineral Soil',type = "scatter", mode = "lines+markers")

## Thermal Diffusivity (K)


$K$ indicates how quickly soil at depth will warm or cool in response to heating or cooling at the surface.

{{< include ../_Equations/Thermal-Diffusivity.qmd >}}

* How fast will a temperature wave diffuse downward into soil.  Proportional to rate of heat conduction ($k$) to and inversely proportional to the heat capacity ($C$).
  + Units: m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>



::: {.notes}

This is another concept related to heat transfer

## Mineral vs. Organic Soil



```{r}
#| label: fig-Diffusivity
#| fig-cap: Thermal diffusivity has an interesting relationship with $\theta_w$

Data <- read.csv(file = 'Data/Lecture10/Diffusivity.csv',sep=',', check.names = FALSE)

fig <- plot_ly(data=Data)

fig <- fig %>% add_trace(x = ~X, y = ~OrganicSoil, name = 'Organic Soil',type = "scatter", mode = "lines+markers")

  ),
  margin = Margin_m,

)

fig

```




## Why the Curious Shape?

$k$ increases rapidly with initial increase in water content ($\theta_w$) causing $K$ to also increase rapidly. 

+ At higher $\theta_w$ the slow increase in k together with the steady rise of $C$ (in the denominator) causes $K$ to decline. 


## Practical Implications

There is an optimum water content for warming, referred to as “field capacity”.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}


* Organic soils are difficult to manage from a soil temperature perspective. 
* Sand is sometimes added to organic soils to increase $K$ in agriculture. 
* In forestry organic material around seedlings is removed or mixed with the subsurface mineral soil

## Soil temperature waves


The variation of temperature with depth can be thought of as waves moving down through the soil in response to radiation “forcing” at the surface.

* There are annual waves, diurnal waves, and waves with shorter periods due to clouds
* In typical mineral soils: 
  + Annual waves penetrate to ~ 10 m
  + Diurnal waves to ~ 50 cm
  + Cloud waves to ~ 5 cm





## Annual Waves

```{r}
#| label: Monthly

fig <- plot_ly(data=Data)

fig <- fig %>% add_trace(x = ~TimeStamp, y = ~TS_1, name = '5 cm',type = "scatter", mode = "lines+markers")

fig <- fig %>% add_trace(x = ~TimeStamp, y = ~TS_2, name = '10 cm',type = "scatter", mode = "lines+markers")

fig <- fig %>% add_trace(x = ~TimeStamp, y = ~TS_3, name = '50 cm',type = "scatter", mode = "lines+markers")

## Soil Thermal Admittance $\mu$

The ability of the soil surface to accept or release heat following a change in soil heat flux ($H_G$). How well it can “soak it up” without changing temperature much. It is given by:

{{< include ../_Equations/Thermal-Admittance.qmd >}}

* $\mu$ is the soil thermal admittance; $k$ is the thermal conductivity and $C$ is the heat capacity
  + Note the similarities to thermal diffusivity @eq-Thermal-Diffusivity
  + Units: J m<sup>-2</sup> K<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1/2</sup>


## Thermal Admittance and Surface Temperature 

For a change in soil heat flux (i.e., $\Delta H_G$), the change in surface temperature ($\Delta T_s$) is inversely proportional to $\mu$

High u: quickly takes up heat from your hand (~35°C) because of it’s high k and C

## Energy Balance of Ecosystems


![Soil heat flux is a component of the total energy balance](images/Energy_Balance.png){width="65%"}

## Energy Balance of Ecosystems

Net radiation ($R_n$) is partitioned between latent heat fluxes ($H_L$), sensible heat fluxes ($H_S$), ground heat fluxes ($H_G$), and residual storage component ($\Delta S$).

* $\Delta S$ includes photosynthesis and other minor outlets

{{< include ../_Equations/Energy-Balance.qmd >}}

## Heat sharing


The partitioning of total 'sensible' heat flux between the soil ($H_G$) and the atmosphere ($H_S$). 
 

{{< include ../_Equations/Heat-Sharing.qmd >}} 

* Soil ($H_G$) and atmosphere ($H_S$) share in accepting heat during daytime and releasing heat at night
* $\mu_g$ and $\mu_a$ are the soil and atmospheric thermal admittance respectively
  + $\mu_a$ increases with wind speed and convection (mixing)







## Summary on Soil Climates


* $K$ depends on soil type (largely due to porosity but also organic matter content) and soil water content $\theta_w$.
* Mineral soil has deeper temperature wave penetration (warms faster) than organic soil, and wetter soil has deeper temperature wave penetration than dry soil. 
* Presence of surface organic layer has a strong effect on depth of T waves, the average T at depth, and the range of surface T.

## Take home points {.smaller}


* Fourier’s law of heat conduction - A change in soil temperature with depth (i.e. a temperature gradient) is proportional to a heat flux density. 
* Thermal conductivity $k$ relates the temperature gradient to the heat flux density. 
* k is increasing with soil water content - but not linearly. 
* Thermal diffusivity $K$ = k / C combines the effect of thermal conductivity and heat capacity and indicates how quickly soil at depth will warm or cool in response to heating or cooling at the surface 
* Thermal admittance $\mu \sqrt{k C}$ is the ability of a surface to accept or release heat
* Thermal admittance increases with water content of the soil. 
* Low thermal admittance explains why some soil surfaces (dry surface organic layer) get very hot and cold (frost damage to young plants) 
* Heat sharing refers to partitioning of energy between soil and atmosphere. Mulches change soil temp by altering heat sharing
