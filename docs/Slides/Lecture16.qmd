## Why does the wind blow?

## Why does the wind blow?

Three main factors affect the horizontal motion of the air:

1.  Pressure gradient force: drives flow
2.  Coriolis effect: "deflects" flow
3.  Friction: slows flow

The velocity (speed and direction) of the wind at any time is the result of these three vector forces.


## Atmospheric Pressure $P_a$


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

* Recall: $P_a$ decreases exponentially with height
  + $P_a \approx$ Weight of the air
* Following the ideal gas law, $P_a$ is a function of temperature and density

In this scenario the column expands:

* $rho$ decreases
* $P_a$ (at the surface) remains the same 
  + Mass of air above surface does not change

## Pressure Gradient Force

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}


Air flows from higher to lower pressure.  This is the main driving force for winds.

* Speed set by spacing of the isobars 
  + i.e. the pressure gradient 
  + Acts at right angles to the isobars.

## Semi-Permanent Highs and Lows

Semi-permanent High and Low pressure systems occur in preferred locations (e.g. Hawaiian, Bermuda, Siberian Highs; Aleutian, Icelandic Lows)

* Patterns are clearer in the Southern Hemisphere because the distribution of land-sea is simple
* Pay-to-day these systems tend to move continuously (in the mid-latitudes typically from west to east)


## Coriolis Effect

An *apparent force* due to the rotation of Earth.

:::: {.columns}

* Rotation of the Earth's around its axis "deflects" winds
  + Primary reason flow is **not** parallel to isobars

A function of wind speed ($V$), Earth's rotational velocity ($\Omega$), and latitude ($\phi$):

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

{{< include ../_Equations/Coriolis-Effect.qmd >}}

* Deflects flow to the right (left) in the N (S) Hemisphere

## Coriolis Effect (iClicker)

All else equal, at which Latitude would the Coriolis effect be the strongest?

* A 10 $^\circ$ N
* B 20 $^\circ$ S
* C 50 $^\circ$ N
* D 65 $^\circ$ S


## Heating on a global scale

Lower latitudes show a radiative surplus, the higher latitudes show a radiative deficit. Global wind system is driven by unequal heating of the Earth by the Sun.

## The Three-Cell Model

Poleward transport of energy aims to "correct" the imbalance. Winds are deflected by Coriolis force, resulting in trade winds, westerlies, and polar easterlies.

## The Three-Cell Model


The three cells form bands of uplift (cloudy, stormy, wet) around Equator (ITCZ = Inter Tropical Convergence Zone) and Polar front and subsidence (cloud-free, dry) in Sub-tropical desert belt and Poles. 




![](images/Lecture16/30_7.jpg)


## The Three-Cell Model

The three-cell model describes "average" global circulation patterns, but in reality there are seasonal and longitudinal variations due to the change in the Sun’s position and the ocean-land distribution.


![](images/Lecture16/30_7.jpg)



## Coriolis Effect


As winds move across a pressure gradient, they are deflected by the Coriolis effect, causing them to flow parallel to the pressure gradient.

![](images/Lecture16/Geostrophic.gif)



## Frictional force


* Friction (aka drag) of air over the Earth’s surface slows the wind.
  + Effect is greatest near the surface
* Since the Coriolis is a function of wind speed:
  + Coriolis force is weaker near the surface
  + Deflection due to Coriolis force is greater aloft




## Effects of Friction on Wind

## Cyclones

## Anticyclones


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

* An anticyclone is a large area which experiences rotating winds, circling around the region with high pressure.

## Explore for Yourself

[Windy.com](https://www.windy.com/-Show---add-more-layers/overlays?49.822,-122.432,5,i:pressure) is a fun tool you can use to explore for yourself.

## Take home points

* Winds are caused by the pressure gradient force which is equalizing horizontal pressure differences.
* Once in motion, the Coriolis force and friction act, causing deflection and slowing of the wind. 
* On a global scale the energy transport is deflected, creating three distinct cells (Hadley, Ferrel and Polar cell) in each hemisphere.
* On a smaller scale it creates thermal lows and highs (cyclones and anticyclones).
