## Learning objectives


* Describe the differences between continental / maritime and polar / tropical air masses.
* Explain the difference between warm fronts, cold fronts and occluded front.
* Explain what causes weather systems to develop and decay.

## Air masses

An air mass is a large body of air (1000's km across) with roughly uniform properties.

* **Continental** air tends to be drier with more extreme temperatures
* **Maritime** air tends to be wetter with more moderate temperatures
* **Tropical** air is warmer than **Polar** air


## Air Mass Types {.smaller}

Air masses are classified according to their source region

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}


* Maritime Tropical (mT): Warm & moist
* Continental Tropical (cT): Hot & dry
* Maritime Polar (mP): Cool & moist
* Continental Polar (cP): Cold & dry
* Continental Arctic (cA): Frigid & dry

* A: Maritime Polar
* B: Maritime Tropical
* C: Continental Arctic
* D: Continental Polar


## Fronts

A front is the transition zone between two contrasting air masses. There are 3 important characteristics of fronts:  

* Vertical ascent of warm air mass, producing clouds.
* Horizontal motion of fronts, sometimes at more than 50 km/h, resulting in rapid change in weather conditions.
* Discontinuity of temperature, humidity and wind direction.

Two key types of fronts: **Cold** and **Warm**

## Cold Fronts

Cold, dense air "undercuts" warm air forcing it aloft along the front.  Commonly associated with:

::: {.column width="50%"}


* Cumulonimbus clouds & heavy rain
* Strong wind & severe weather
* Followed by clear skies
* Typical slope 1:40 – 1:50

## Cold Fronts

How would you know if a cold front occurred? 

* Heavy rain followed by a temperature drop and cold clear high pressure air

## Severe Weather

## Warm Fronts

## Movement of Fronts

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Cold fronts and warm fronts are continuously chasing each other around the mid-latitudes

* Cold fronts travel faster than warm fronts, so they eventually catch up

::: {.notes}

The classical and usual view of an occluded front is that it initiates when a cold front overtakes a warm front near a cyclone, such that the warm air is separated (occluded) from the cyclone center at the surface

## Jet Streams


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Ribbons of high speed winds (160-400 km h-1) encircling the globe aloft (10-15 km). 

* Snake around the globe from W to E and steer weather disturbances (mid-latitude Lows)
* Generally aligned with air mass boundaries at the surface

## Link Between Jet Stream and Ground


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

To form cyclones, it is important to consider the form of divergence in the jet stream. 

* Cyclones cannot persist if they do not have upper-level support.

## Life Cycle of Cyclones – Early

Stage starts with a relatively stationary front separating polar (cold) and subtropical (warm) air masses. 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

* A slight dynamic low created by the divergent jet stream aloft pulls air in, so cold air penetrates into the warm air,  and warm air moves towards the cold air. 
* The center of the disturbance starts to rotate.

## Life Cycle of Cyclones – Open

Two fronts (one cold, one warm) are evident.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

* The denser cold air undercuts the warm air, and the warm air overrides the cold air ahead of it
* The uplift is enhanced by the release of latent heat, as ascending air rises above the lifting condensation level & cloud develops.

## Life Cycle of Cyclones – Occlusion

The occluded stage begins when the cold front catches up with the warm front near the low pressure center. 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

* The cold air at ground level undercuts the warm air pushing it further aloft. 
* The ‘warm sector’ is systematically eliminated, as more cold air comes in.  
* This influx destroys the system.

## Life Cycle of Cyclones - Dissolving

The dissolving stage is the end of the cyclone’s life.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

* Warm air aloft is separated from its source and gradually mix with the surrounding cold air.

## Forecasting 101

1. Analysis: examine to determine what is happening

2. Diagnosis: why is it happening?

3. Prognosis: forecast the likely outcomes 



## Scales of Forecasting



* Global: Largest patterns over longest time-scales (e.g., climate change)

* Synoptic: Continental scale, multi-day weather patterns

* Mesoscale: Smaller spatial scale, daily to hourly patterns

* Microscale: Ecosystem-scale, short time-scale (hours to minutes)


## Forecasting Challenges in British Columbia


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

* Mountains and complex terrain

## Take home points {.smaller}



* Air masses is a large body of air with roughly uniform humidity and temperature depending on their origin 
* Fronts are the transition zone between two contrasting air masses
* We distinguish between cold fronts (cold air undercuts warm air) and warm fronts (where warm air rides up over colder air ahead of it)
* The life-cycle of cyclones is a dynamic process starting with initially two separate fronts (cold / warm) that will combine to a occlusion and eventually dissolve the energy.
* Weather forecasting is difficult and especially difficult in BC
* Climate change has changed the timing and intensity of many weather events 
* There is increasing focus on forecasting of severe events including wildfires, heat (and cold) extremes as well as precipitation events such as Atmospheric Rivers
