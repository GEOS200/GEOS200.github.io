## Atmospheric Humidity {.smaller}

Water vapor makes up small part of atmosphere, but has important physical and biological significance because:

## Atmospheric Humidity


* The heat released by condensing 1 g of water is enough to raise 1 kg of air (0.8 m<sup>3</sup>) by 2.5 °C 
  + Due to water’s very high heat of vaporization, 2450 J g<sup>-1</sup>
  + Freezing water releases another 330 J g<sup>-1</sup>
* We feel cold after coming out of a swimming pool because the heat used for evaporation of the water comes from our skin

## Vapor Density

Vapor density ($\rho_v$) is the mass of water vapor per unit volume of air (g m<sup>-3</sup>); it is the fundamental measure of humidity.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

* The ‘driving force’ for evaporation is the $\rho_v$ gradient between an evaporating surface and the surrounding air.

## Vapor Pressure

Vapor pressure ($P_v$) is the partial pressure (aka force) exerted by water vapor in a parcel of air.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

* A slightly more abstract measure of humidity.

* Mean sea level air pressure is 101.325 kPa
* $P_v \leq 5 kPa$

## Mixing Ratio {.smaller}

Water vapor content can also be expressed as a mixing ratio, which gives the abundance of one component of a mixture (H<sub>2</sub>O) relative to all other components ("dry air").

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

$r_{H2O} = \frac{m_{H2O}}{m_{dry}}$
$m_{dry} = m_{total} - m_{H2O}$

* Usually parts per thousand for water vapor
  - g H<sub>2</sub>O per kg dry air

* In this example:

$m_{dry} = 608.5 g - 23 g = 0.5855 kg$

$r_{H2O} = \frac{23 g}{0.5855 kg} = 39.28 \frac{g}{kg}$

## Ideal Gas Law

Describes the state of a gas as a function of pressure ($P$), volume ($V$), temperature ($T$) in Kelvin, the amount of the gas ($n$) in moles; and the ideal gas constant ($R$ = 8.314 x 10 $^{-3}$ kPa m $^3$ g $^{-1}$ K $^{-1}$).  

{{< include ../_Equations/Ideal-Gas-Law.qmd >}}

* $n = \frac{m}{M}$, where $m$ is the mass of the substance and $M$ is the Molar mass of the substance.
* Can be applied to a mixture of gasses (e.g., dry air) or a single gas (e.g., water vapor)


## Ideal Gas Law

The molar mass of water is 18.015 g mol $^{-1}$.  Given this, we can redefine @eq-Ideal-Gas-Law in terms of $\rho_v$ and $P_v$ as @eq-Ideal-Gas-Law-Vapor-Density.

{{< include ../_Equations/Ideal-Gas-Law-Vapor-Density.qmd >}}

* This allows us to convert between $\rho_v$ and $P_v$
  + Knowing one, allows easy calculation of the other

## Saturation

The ability of air to hold water vapor increases exponentially with temperature.

* We add a "$^*$" to indicate saturation:
  + Saturation vapor density $\rho_v^*$ 
  + Saturation vapor pressure $P_v^*$



## Laten Heat


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}


Determining $\rho_v^*$ or $P_v^*$ for a given $T$ requires integrating the Clausius–Clapeyron equation.

* The latent heat of vaporization $L$ is also varies as a function of $T$

## Saturation

Luckily, some experimentally based empirical relationships have been developed for typical conditions on Earth's surface.

* It turns out temperature ($T$) and pressure ($P$) changes have an equal and opposite effect on saturation pressure $P_v^*$
  + We can calculate $P_v^*$ to $\pm$ 0.1% for typical temperature conditions using the empirically derived Buck Equation:

{{< include ../_Equations/Buck-Equation.qmd >}}




## Saturation

```{R}
Buck_Equation <- function(T){
	# Takes T in deg C and returns P_v in kPa
	P_v <- 0.61121*exp((18.678-T/234.5)*(T/(257.14+T)))
	return(P_v)
}

Ideal_Gas_Law_Vapor_Density <- function(T,P_v){
	# Takes T in deg C and vapor pressure in kPa; converts T to K; then returns the rho_v in g m-3
	R <- 8.31446261815324e-3 # Ideal Gas Constant in kPa m$^3$ K$^{-1}$ mol$^{-1}$ 
	M <- 18.01528 # Molar mass of H20 in g m-3
	T_k <- T + 273.15
	rho_v = P_v*M/(R*T_k)
	return (rho_v)
}

Humidity is often expressed as a fraction or % of the maximum
water vapor the air can hold:


:::


## Dewpoint temperature (Td)

The temperature down to which the air must be cooled isobarically (without changing air pressure) for it to become saturated.

![Can be measured with a silver coated cooled mirror. $T_d$ is the temperature of the mirror when water vapor condenses on it.](images/Lecture11/19_2.png)


## Dewpoint Calculation (iClicker)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

You can determine $T_d$ from $\rho_v$ or $P_v$ using the relationship between $T$ and $\rho_v^*$ or $P_v^*$

* If $T$ = 20 °C and $P_v$ = 1.7 kPa, what is $T_d$?

  + A 20 °C
  + B 15 °C

## Condensation


If an air parcel to cools below $T_d$, condensation will<sup>*</sup> occur.

* Condensation **releases** heat which warms the surrounding environment
  + Cloud formation is an important avenue of energy exchange

* Condensation nuclei are required to initiate condensation.
  + In the absence nuclei, which can occur in the upper atmosphere, air will become *supersaturated*
  + Earth's surface is a nuclei, so supersaturation doesn't occur near the surface.




## Relative Humidity

Humidity can be expressed as a fraction or % of the maximum (saturation) water vapor the air can hold at that temperature:

{{< include ../_Equations/Relative-Humidity.qmd >}}

* RH depends on T because $\rho_v^*$ is a function of T



## Relative Humidity and Temperature

The variation in RH during the day is largely determined by the variation in temperature.

## Importance of RH

* Determines the water content of porous media e.g., wood, soil, clothing, which has been allowed to equilibrate with the air.
* Low RH (< 30%) contributes to high risk of forest fire  
* Metal corrosion is directly related to RH.
* Many plant diseases are strongly affected by RH.

## Relative Humidity example

* In the classroom, $T$ = 21 °C and $\rho_v$ = 9 g m<sup>-3</sup>. What is the RH?  
  + First determine  $\rho_v^*$ using the graph. It is $\approx$ 18 g m<sup>-3</sup>.
  + Then RH =  $\rho_v$ / $\rho_v^*$ = (9/18) x 100% = 50%.


## Vapor Density Deficit (VDD)


The increase in $\rho_v$ necessary to bring the air to saturation  It is expressed as:

{{< include ../_Equations/Vapor-Density-Deficit.qmd >}}

* RH doesn’t determine the rate of evaporation or condensation 
  + The difference between vapor density at the exchange surface and the air determines it!


## VDD (iClicker)


In the classroom, T = 21°C and $\rho_v$ = 9 g m<sup>-3</sup>. We know that $\rho_v^* \approx$ 18 g m<sup>-3</sup>. So What is the VDD?  


::: {.fragment}

$VDD = rho_v^* - rho_v =$ 9 g m<sup>-3</sup>

## Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD)

## Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD)


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

Rates of photosynthesis are influenced by VPD.

* With increasing VPD, photosynthesis first becomes more efficient as the pressure gradient aids gas transfer between the leaves and the atmosphere
* Then it has a strong limiting effect as plants close their stomata to avoid excess water loss

## Measuring Humidity {.smaller}


* RH has been measured by different methods:  Leonardo de Vinci used the weight of a ball of wool.
* de Saussure invented the hair hygrometer (2.5% change in length for 0 to 100% RH).
* At fire weather stations, the weight of small sticks of wood has been used.
* More recently changes in electrical conductivity resulting from adsorption of water vapor by a thin polymer film coated on small sensing chips has proven to be very effective. 
  + These are commonly used in climate stations.

## Take home points {.smaller}

* Makes up small part of atmosphere but is the main greenhouse gas 
* Large latent heat of vaporization (conversion of liquid to vapor) 
* Relationship of vapor density to vapor pressure by ideal gas law 
* Saturation vapor density (ability of air to store water vapor) (v *) is exponentially related to temperature 
* RH (v/v *) and VDD (v * - v) are very sensitive to temperature 
* vapor density difference determines rate of H2O vapor transfer 
* RH determines equilibrium water content of porous materials such as fire fuels & affects animal comfort, plant disease & metal corrosion 
* Leaf stomata close as VDD or VPD increases
