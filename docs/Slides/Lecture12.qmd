## Learning Objectives

* Describe how temperature changed over time in the atmosphere.
* Explain how temperature changes with height in the atmosphere.
* Be able to compare the difference between the ELR and the process lapse rate to distinguish between unstable, neutral or stable atmospheric stratifications 
* Give examples of how the stratification (stability) of the atmosphere controls mixing and dispersion.

## Structure of the Atmosphere


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}


Earth's atmosphere is thousands of kilometers thick.

* But almost all of it's mass (>75%) is in the troposphere
  + Narrow zone closest to the surface
* Exosphere is a broad transition zone to the vacuum of space

There are $\approx$ `r kg_cm` kg of air above **every** cm<sup>2</sup> of Earth's surface

* This mass exerts pressure on the Earth's surface, and everything on it

## Negative Buoyancy

## Anabatic vs. Katabatic


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}


**Anabatic**: upward flow along a slope due to warming of air at the surface


**Katabatic**: downward flow along a slope due to cooling of air at the surface

* Responsible for "Arctic Outflow" events.  Locally known as a squamish



:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

![](images/Lecture12/MountainWinds.jpg)

## Atmospheric Stability

Buoyancy is mainly due to $T$ differences, but $\rho_v$ differences can also affect buoyancy.

**Stability** is relative tendency for parcels to move vertically due to the environmental $T$ profile (layering and the rate at which T changes with height, i.e. lapse rate).

*   Stable -  vertical motion is suppressed
*   Neutral -  there is no relative vertical motion tendency
*   Unstable -  vertical motion is promoted or enhanced


## Adiabatic Processes

Even though the heat content of the parcel is conserved, $T$ changes because the air pressure ($P$) decreases with height and the volume $V$ of the parcel changes.  

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="80%"}

* On ascent, $P$ decreases, the parcel expands and the work done causes the parcel $T$ to drop. 
  + The reverse is true if the parcel sinks
    - It compresses and warms. 
  + See @eq-Ideal-Gas-Law-Temperature

## Adiabatic Processes – key points


* Temperature changes are internal to the rising and descending air parcel
* Occurs without heat being added or withdrawn from the surrounding environment
* Changes in pressure cause a change in temperature
* Parcels moving vertically through the Atmosphere do not mix with the surrounding air very effectively 
  - The properties of the parcel are conserved during ascent/descent 




## Test your knowledge (iClicker)

As an air parcel rises it ______________ and its temperature _____________ adiabatically


* Expands, warms
* Expands, cools
* Compresses, warms
* Compresses, cools


## Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate


The **dry adiabatic lapse rate (DALR)** is the rate of cooling/warming for a dry parcel of air that is rises/descends through the atmosphere.

* Has a constant with a value of $\pm$ 0.01 K m<sup>-1</sup>.  
  + Will be negative (cooling) if a parcel is being lifted upwards and be positive (warming) for a parcel that is descending


## Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate

The **saturated adiabatic lapse rate (SALR)** applies once a parcel of air reaches saturation. 

* A saturated parcel cools as it rises but condensation occurs which releases latent heat and counteracts some of the cooling.  
  + **Only** applies to cooling air, when air warms it will always do so at the DALR, because as soon as the air begins to warm, it will no longer be saturated.  


## Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

The SALR is non-linear function of $T$ and $P$

+ $T$ varies as a function of $P$
+ The latent heat released by condensation varies with $T$
+ The amount of water that must condense also varies with $T$

The **lifting condensation level (LCL)** is the height to which a parcel must be lifted for condensation to occur.

:::




## Assessing Stability


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="100%"}

* To determine stability we compare the temperature of the air parcel to the temperature of the surrounding environment.
* If an air parcel is warmer than its environment it will rise
* If an air parcel is colder than its environment it will sink
* You should also compare the process lapse rate to the environmental lapse rate (ELR)

## Classifying Stability {.smaller}

Stability is determined by comparing the Environmental Lapse Rate (ELR) to the Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate (DALR = -0.01 K m<sup>-1</sup>) and the Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate (SALR; not constant but often assumed to be -0.005 K m<sup>-1</sup>).

* The ELR is not constant.  It will vary by time of day, location, and height.

## Summary: Comparing lapse rates


* Unstable: ELR < DALR (-0.01 K m<sup>-1</sup>)
* Stable: ELR > SALR ($\approx$ -0.005 K m <sup>-1</sup>)
* Neutral: ELR = DALR (-0.01 K m)
* Conditionally unstable = DALR (-0.01 K m<sup>-1</sup>) < ELR < SALR ($\approx$ -0.005 K m <sup>-1</sup>)
  + By definition, Neutral is also conditionally unstable

## Potential temperature

To ‘remove’ the effects of pressure change with height we can remove the dry adiabatic lapse rate and calculate the potential temperature θ as: 

{{< include ../_Equations/Potential-Temperature.qmd >}}



* θ is the temperature the air would have it were brought to a reference air pressure (typically a 100 kPa, 1000 mb). This standardization of the temperature is the same as rotating all T profiles to the right by the slope of DALR.

* Times of maximum and minimum temperature at the surface occur when rates of energy input and output cross.
  + Temperature changes in the upper atmosphere are muted and time-lagged
* Temperature changes with height in the atmosphere - environmental lapse rate (ELR)
* Parcels moving up or down change their temperature adiabatically - the process lapse rate (i.e., DALR or SALR)
