One of our applications in forest and agricultural climatology is themodelling and measurement of short-wave irradiance at the ground after passing through Earth’s atmosphere.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="100%"}

* The main modification to overcome the non-uniformity of leaves is to replace distance (x) with the cumulative leaf area index (LAI).
* What is LAI?
  + The leaf area index is the one-sided leaf (and stem) area per unit ground area.

Here we modify Beer’s Law to use Leaf area with depth, something that can be done for different canopies

It is defined as the one-sided green leaf (and stem) area per unit ground surface area (LAI = leaf area / ground area, m2 / m2) in broadleaf canopies.

In conifers, three definitions for LAI have been used:
Half of the total needle surface area per unit ground surface area [2]
Projected (or one-sided, in accordance the definition for broadleaf canopies) needle area per unit ground area
Total needle surface area per unit ground area [3]

## Modifying Beer’s Law 

Cumulative LAI (L) = sum of LAI


* Integration of LAI through canopy starting at top of canopy

![](images/Lecture5/11_2.png)


::: {.notes}

You can see how this might work and notice how we make the switch to a cumulative index as we go down into the canopy.
In the next slide you will see how we can use this to modify the Beer’s Law equation with one that has L rather than distance x

## Leaf Orientation

The canopy attenuation coefficient is related to the orientation of the leaves in relation to the sun angle:

In fact we take account of leaf orientation in the canopy extinction coefficient.

## Spatial Heterogeneity

Consider the similarity/dissimilarity across space.

* A **homogenous** canopy will have a more even distribution across
  + The attenuation coefficient will be less variable

* A **heterogeneous** canopy will have a less even distribution across
  + The attenuation coefficient will be more variable

## Radiation beneath plant canopies

* Diffuse (d) radiation penetrates the canopy more effectively than direct (s) radiation
  + Ratio $\frac{SW_d\downarrow}{SW_s\downarrow}$ increases with depth into canopy.
  + Scattering of direct radiation helps increase proportion of diffuse PAR in the canopy.
* $\frac{NIR\downarrow}{PAR\downarrow}$ increases with depth into canopy.
  + The high PAR absorptivity of leaves in the upper canopy results in depleted PAR in the lower canopy.

::: {.notes}

This graph really just illustrates that understory plants (the red symbols that include ferns and salal) are more efficient photosynthesisers at low amounts of PAR (the left side of the graph). Alternatively the trees (Green – Maples) do better with high amounts of PAR such as you find high up in the canopy.

## Take home points


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="100%"}

* Radiative transfer through plant canopies can be approximated using Beer’s Law using the cumulative Leaf Area Index (L) instead of the distance, plus path length and a clumping factor.
* Radiation within plant canopies is not uniformly distributed in space, time (‘sunflecks’) and with regard to spectral characteristics.
* We can use radiative transfer theory to infer the LAI of a stand if we measure short-wave radiation transmission.
