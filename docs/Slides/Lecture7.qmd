## Learning Objectives

* Because radiation is the only transfer mechanism between our planet and the Sun / Space we can calculate the theoretical radiation budget of Planet Earth.
* Know how to estimate the expected ‘temperature’ of our planet based on our calculation.
* Understand how the presence of the atmosphere affects the temperature on our planet.

## Earth's Surface Temperature (iClicker)

The area terms ($\pi R^2$) in @eq-Planetary-Energy-Balance cancel on both sides; leaving us with

$(1-\alpha)I_0 = 4\epsilon\sigma_b T^4$



:::: {.columns}

Rearranging to solve for T:

$T = \sqrt[4]{\frac{(1-\alpha)I_0}{4\epsilon\sigma_b}}$


```{R}
#| echo: True

I0 <- 1361 # W m-2
alpha <- 0.31
epsilon <- 0.95
sigma <- 5.67e-8 # W m-2 K-4

T = ((1-alpha)*I0/(4*epsilon*sigma))**.25

```

$T \approx$  `r round(T,digits=1)` K

## Effect of an atmosphere

```{R}

T_s <- 15+273.15

T_no_at <- T

```

Earth’s known average surface temperature is `r round(T_s-273.15,digits=1)` &deg; C. 

* The previous calculation underestimates surface temperature because we have not incorporated the atmosphere i.e. the effects of greenhouse gases. 

* Without an atmosphere it  would be  $T \approx$  `r round(T-273.15,digits=1)` &deg; C on Earth on average. 
  + The effect of the atmosphere (natural greenhouse effect) must be worth $\approx$ `r round(T_s-T,digits=1)` K!


## The ‘Greenhouse Effect’

The atmosphere has an insulating effect on planet earth.  

* The greenhouse gas effect limits the $\tau_{LW}$ through the atmosphere
  - This effectively reduces Earth's $\epsilon_{LW}$
  - But how?  Kirchhoff’s law states that $\epsilon_{\lambda} = a_{\lambda}$?
* The $a_{LW}$ is re-emitted **in all directions**
  - i.e., it is recycled 
  - Loss of energy from the surface slowed


## The ‘Greenhouse Effect’


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

The atmosphere is a selective absorber (and emitter) of radiation.

* The transmission window allows some $LW$ through
* Outside of that window, little $LW$ escapes!

## The Effective Emissivity

Since we know the mean surface temperature of the earth, we can instead rearrange @eq-Planetary-Energy-Balance to solve for $\epsilon$:



$\epsilon= \frac{(1-\alpha)I_0}{4\sigma_bT^4}$


```{R}
#| echo: True

I0 <- 1361 # W m-2
alpha <- 0.31
T_s <- 15 # C
sigma <- 5.67e-8 # W m-2 K-4

T = T_s + 273.15

epsilon = (1-alpha)*I0/(4*sigma*T**4)

```

The atmosphere reduces the global value of $\epsilon$ to $\approx$ `r round(epsilon,3)`


## Radiative Output

Since we now have a reasonable estimate of $\epsilon$, we estimate planetary emissions following @eq-Planetary-Emission.

$F_{out} = AI_{out} = 4\pi R^{2}\epsilon\sigma_b T^4$


```{R}
#| echo: True

I_out = epsilon*sigma*T**4

R = 6378.1 # km
R = R * 1000

F_out = 4*pi*R**2*I_out

```

The average flux density of $LW$ at the top of Earth's atmosphere $I_{out} \approx$ `r round(I_out,1)` W m<sup>-2</sup>

The average flux of $LW$ from Earth $F_{out} \approx$ `r round(F_out)` W


## Radiative Output (iClicker)

Our estimated value of $I_{out}$ (`r round(I_out,1)` W m<sup>-2</sup>) $\neq I_0$ (`r round(I0)` W m<sup>-2</sup>).  

What accounts for the discrepancy?


A - $I_0$ is distributed across Earth's silhouette area $A^*$; we need distribute $I_0$ across Earth's total surface area $A$

B - A portion of $I_0$ is never absorbed by the Earth due to the planetary Albedo ($\alpha \approx 0.31$)

C - Both A & B


## Radiative Output

If we account for both, we'll get the average flux density at the top of Earth's Atmosphere across the **Full** electromagnetic spectrum.

* $\bar{I_0} = \frac{I_0}{4}$ = `r I0/4` W m<sup>-2</sup> 

* $\bar{I_0}= \bar{I_0} \alpha + I_{out}$ = `r I0/4*alpha` W m<sup>-2</sup> + `r I_out`  W m<sup>-2</sup>

## Latent Heat Flux (iClicker)


How is a latent heat flux into the Atmosphere realized?

* A - Water is vaporized  by radiation at the surface and condenses in clouds - there it warms up air.
* B - Radiation absorption at surface warms up air near surface - warm air rises and transports extra heat to higher layers of atmosphere.
* C - Rain releases its geopotential energy as raindrops splash at the surface - they warm up the surface more than the atmosphere.


::: {.notes}

Answer is A

## Take home points


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="100%"}

* The planet is using (absorbing) only 69% of the solar radiation received. The planetary albedo is 31%.
* Without atmosphere it would be  `r T_no_at-273.5`$&deg; C on Earth on average. The natural greenhouse effect is worth `r round(T_no_at-T,digits=1)` K.
* The atmosphere is in a radiative deficit and the Planet’s surface shows a radiative surplus. Sensible and latent heat fluxes offset the radiative imbalance, i.e. transport energy from the surface into the atmosphere.
