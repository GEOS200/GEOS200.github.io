::: {.notes}

The “solar constant represents about the upper limit for solar energy in the Earth-atmosphere system. Imagine astronauts in the space station doing a space walk where they take a a board that is 1 meter by one meter and then measuring how much radiation falls on it when they point it directly at the sun. 
NOTE: the word “constant” here is a bit misleading. Of courses the distance from the earth varies because of the elliptical orbit of the earth around the sun. The differences are small however.

## Attenuation of solar radiation (iClicker)

On its path from the top of the atmosphere to the ground, solar radiation is reduced. Why?

* A - Reflected back to space by clouds
* B - Scattered by aerosols and droplets
* C - Absorbed by certain gases, droplets and aerosols
* D - All of the above


## Reflection

Clouds reflect 40 to 80% of the short-wave radiation incident upon them, the average is 55%.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

* We call this the cloud albedo ($\alpha$), hence the ratio of the amount of solar (short-wave) radiation reflected by a body to the amount incident upon it.

::: {.notes}

Reflection from clouds is really important! This is why the earth looks so bright from space. Clouds viewed from the sides or above are also very white (an indicator that they are reflecting all wavelengths of visible light).

## Absorption in the atmosphere

The most significant absorbing substances are:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

* H<sub>2</sub>O (vapor), CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub>
* The atmosphere is quite transparent ($\tau \approx 1$) near $\lambda_{max}$ = 0.48 $\mu m$ 
  + Intensity of solar radiation is greatest here

Scattering of light by the atmosphere

:::

::: {.notes}

The next images show some of the optical effects of the atmosphere. Some of these are best seen when the sun in low in the sky (sunrise and sunset) and the sun’s rays are passing slantwise through the atmosphere (we call this a long “path-length”) 

:::


## Scattering

Scattering (diffuse reflection) is when incident light is diffused in **all** directions by the small molecules.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

* Reduces solar radiation reaching the ground
* Diffuse the beam so that it arrives from all parts of the sky hemisphere.

![Scattering by particle size](images/Lecture3/18_3.png)

:::

::::


## Scattering

* **Rayleigh**: caused by gas molecules. Tends to scatter in all directions with a preference for shorter wavelengths
* **Mie**: associated with larger solid or liquid particles. Scatters wavelength equally and mostly in a forward direction.

![Scattering by particle size](images/Lecture3/18_3.png)

## Transmission

* Typical fractions of the solar getting through to the ground are:
  + “Clean” atmosphere $\tau$ = 0.65-0.75
  + “Dirty” atmosphere $\tau$ = 0.45-0.55
  + In Vancouver, a typical value is $\tau$ = 0.70


## Transmission Windows

::::{.columns}

::: {.notes}

See Video: The “Atmospheric Window” is an important concept. You need to understand it. Simply put, the window part is analogy. It implies that in the 8-11 micrometer longwave (terrestrial) part of the radiation spectrum where there are no gases that absorb outgoing longwave radiation from the earth/atmosphere. Therefore this radiation is free to escape to space through these wavelengths. If this wasn’t the case, then the earth would continue to heat up over time. The role of “greenhouse” gases in the atmosphere is of course part of this story

## Cosine law of illumination

Describes how incident radiant flux density (irradiance) of a beam decreases as the beam’s angle varies from overhead.

This is an important concept! Try it yourself at home with a flashlight. You can also shine it on a globe (or ball) to see the impact on Latitude (ie.e why the poles receive less radiation than the tropics.

## Cosine law of illumination

Flux density on a surface ($R_s$) is proportional to the flux density perpendicular to a beam ($R_p$) and the zenith ($\theta$).

* For a flat land surface **at solar noon**

## Cosine law of illumination (iClicker) {.smaller}

Compare the the flux density of a beam of sunlight **at solar noon** on **the autumnal equinox** at the equator and at the Arctic Circle (66 $^{\circ}$ North latitude).

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="45%"}

*Note*:

* $R_s = R_p cos(\theta)$
* At the equator, the sun is directly overhead: $\theta = 0$
* At 66 $^{\circ}$ N latitude: $\theta = 66$

:::

:::{.column width="55%"}

Irradiance at 66 $^{\circ}$ N would be:

* **A** $\approx$ 66% that at the equator
* **B** $\approx$ 40% that at the equator
* **C** $\approx$ 33% that at the equator

## Irradiance

Shortwave irradiance ($SW\downarrow$) is the integration of all radiative fluxes coming from the upper hemisphere

## Direct vs. Diffuse Irradiance

Two types of solar radiation arrive at the Earth’s surface:

:::: {.columns}

* Direct (s): comes directly in parallel rays from Sun.

## Pyranometer


Solar irradiance $SW\downarrow = SW\downarrow_S + SW\downarrow_D$ is measured by a pyranometer.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

* Glass domes transmit $SW$
  + Prevent conduction / convection
* A thermopile measures the temperature rise of the absorbing black surface


:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

![](images/Lecture3/31_3.png)

:::

::::


::: {.notes}

Inside the double glass dome (to prevent convection and conduction) there is a black absorber disk (the sensing element), which is made of a black carbon with a high absorptivity. The temperature rise of the sensing element due to short-wave irradiance is measured relatively to the (more constant) body temperature of the pyranometer. A thermopile (array of thermocouples) measures the temperature difference, which creates a voltage and then is measured by the data logger. 
The black carbon would be also sensitive to long-wave radiation, but the glass dome filters out the long-wave emission. A double glass dome reduces heating of the inner dome (long-wave emission of the dome).
