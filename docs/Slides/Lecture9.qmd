## Compound Substances 

The heat capacity of a mixture of substances can be calculated from the heat capacity and volume fraction of each component. For soil:

{{< include ../_Equations/Heat-Capacity-Soil.qmd >}}


* $\theta$ is the volume fraction of mineral (m), organic matter (o), water (w) and air (a)
  * *Note*: $C_a$ is very small relative to the other values of C

## Heat Capacity {.smaller}

Organic soils usually have high porosity, so they can hold more water so more heat is required to warm them compared to mineral soils.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-25_2
#| tbl-cap: Heat capacity of natural materials 

Data <- read.csv(file = 'Data/Lecture9/25_2_Table.csv',sep=',',check.names = FALSE)

kable(Data, col.names = gsub("[.]", " ", names(Data)))

```


## Heat Capacity of Soils

## Soil Heat Flux ($H_g$)


Describes the transfer of heat through a volume of soil.


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}


* The heat flux ($H_g$) through a soil layer of depth $z$, is proportional to the rate of soil temperature change ($\Delta T_s$) of time $t$ and the heat capacity ($C$) of the soil.

## Heat Fluxes and Thermal Effects

Positive indicates a surplus of energy at the surface being transferred downwards through the soil via conduction.  Negative indicates a surplus at depth being transferred upwards through the soil via conduction.  

![a. During day, positive heat flux warms the soil b. At night, negative heat flux cools the soil](images/Lecture9/27_2.png){width="80%"}

## Heat Fluxes and Net Radiation


$H_g$ will be correlated with $R_n$, though its not a direct relationship, and the strength of the relationship will vary by site conditions.

## How fast does a moist soil warm up? 

We have a mineral soil with $\approx$ 30% water content by volume, giving it C = 2 MJ m<sup>-3</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>.  With a soil heat flux (H) of 100 W m<sup>-2</sup> going into the soil surface layer of depth z = 0.1 m.  Rearranging @eq-Soil-Heat-Flux we can solve for $\Delta T$:


$\frac{\Delta T}{t} = \frac{1}{C}\frac{H_g}{z}$

$\frac{\Delta T}{t} = \frac{1}{2 MJ m^{-3} K^{-1}}\frac{100 J m^{-2} s^{-1}}{0.1 m}$

::: {.fragment}

```{R}

C = 2e6
z = .1
H = 100

delta_T = H/(C*z)

```
