## Learning Objectives

* Understand how adiabatic processes effect temperature and moisture conditions British Columbia


## The Adiabatic Process Equation {.smaller}

To determine how the temperature of a parcel ($T_p$) will change adiabatically if it is transported between two height levels ($z_1$ & $z_2$), given $T_p(z_1)$ and $T_{dp}(z_1)$:

* Assume DALR = -0.01 K m<sup>-1</sup> SALR = -0.005 K m<sup>-1</sup>
* **Recall**: $\frac{T_{dz_1}-T_{z_1}}{DALR}+z_1$

## Orographic Lift


When air from low elevations is forced up a slope.

* A common occurrence in BC during the winter
  + Moist air from the Pacific Ocean collides with Coast Mountains

* Often results in precipitation on the "windward" side of mountains

  + As air rises it cools, reaching saturation

Largely responsible for maintaining the temperate rain forests of our region.

* Many of the wettest locations in the world:
  + Winds consistently push moist ocean air up mountain slopes

Also responsible for the desert like climate of the Okanagan Valley.

* Despite it's its proximity to the coast, dry hot winds are a persistent in this region

* Many of the driest locations in the world are in the "rainshadow" of large mountain ranges

## The Mountain Problem


This is classic example of these phenomena in Meteorology.  Given $T$ and $T_d$ at the base of a mountain:

LCL = `r LCL` m.a.s.l

## Putting it all Together

I'm going to show you how you can evaluate the adiabatic process equation (APE) in R.  If you'd like to try it out yourself, you can install R on your computer and try it out.

* You can find the materials need [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
  + You can use R studio to evaluate the APE on quizzes/exams if you want
  + Totally not mandatory!  You can do it by hand too.

## Take home points


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="100%"}

* Temperature decreases with height on the windward slope of a mountain
  * Condensation/Precipitation will often occur
* Temperature increases as winds move down the leeward slope of a mountain
  * $RH$ decreases as well, because $T_d$ remains unchanged while $T$ increases
