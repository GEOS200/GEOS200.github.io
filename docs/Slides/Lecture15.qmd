## Cloud formation

Most cloud forms as a result of air being lifted. 



:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}


* When it rises, due to the drop of air pressure, it expands and cools.  
  + **Adiabatic Process** $\Gamma$
* Dry air will cool at the dry adiabatic lapse rate

If $T$ to drops to the dew-point $T_d$ of the air:

* Condensation may occur on small particles in the air
  + Forming droplets and creating clouds
* This is the lifting condensation level or LCL (~ cloud base).

## Saturated adiabatic lapse rate (SALR)

After saturation, the rate of cooling is reduced due to release of latent heat.

## Cloud Formation 

The common processes that lead to cloud formation in the troposphere:

1. Convection

2. Fronts and Convergence

3. Orographic Lift

4. Radiative Cooling (Fog)

## Convection


![Cumulus clouds form as a result of convection](images/Lecture15/9_3.jpg)

## Convection

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}


Some parts of the surface absorb more solar radiation than others, creating thermals

* If the thermal cools to saturation, moisture condenses to form water droplets, and it becomes visible as a cumulus cloud

## Convergence and Fronts

![Low pressure systems result in large-scale cloud formation](images/Lecture15/LowPressure.jpg)


## Convergence and Fronts


A low pressure system causes air to converge (moving towards the center of the system) and rise on a large scale (100's of kilometers). 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}



* This causes widespread ascent of air, cooling and large areas of cloud.
* Multiple cloud types associated with low pressure systems

## Convergence and Fronts

A front is a moving boundary between air mass that tends associate with low pressure systems.  


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}



* **Cold front**: advancing cold air mass
* **Warm front**: advancing warm air mass. 
* Both force warm air to rise in bands along the fronts

## Orographic Lift

## Orographic Lift

![Clouds form on the up slope and dissipate on the down slope](images/Lecture15/Orographic3.jpg)


## Orographic Lift


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Large masses of air rise when they are pushed over a mountain range. 

* Forced lifting along a topographic barrier is called **orographic uplift**. 
* Clouds produced in this way are called orographic clouds.

Fog forms on calm-clear nights when radiative cooling causes surface air to cool below the dewpoint

## Cloud types

![We categorize clouds by height, composition, and form](images/Lecture15/17_3.png)



::: {.notes}

Although there are an infinite variety of cloud shapes, all clouds can be organized into four major categories. 
The international cloud classification scheme recognizes three categories of clouds based on their form


In 1803, Luke Howard, an English naturalist, developed the cloud classification scheme still used today. The World Meteorological Organization published the International Cloud Atlas in 1956, based on Howard’s classification scheme.

Cirrus clouds are high clouds with a feathery appearance that are composed of ice crystals. Cumulus clouds are dome-shaped, bunched clouds, with a flat base and billowy upper portions that often rise high in the troposphere; that is, they show strong vertical development. Stratus clouds are low, flat sheets of clouds.

## Stratus (St)

## Fog



:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

Fog is a cloud that forms near at surface.

* Cooling of the air
  + Radiation, advection, and upslope fog
* Addition of moisture
  + Steam and frontal fog

## Precipitation

Many clouds never produce significant precipitation. 

* Cloud droplets likely to form when the air mass reaches the lifting condensation level
  * No condensation if there without no condensation nuclei

  * Sources of nuclei are dust, smoke, salt, etc. 
  
* Most cloud droplets are tiny (~20 μm radius) and float on air currents 
  + Too small to overcome evaporation on their way to surface




## Precipitation

Droplets must be larger than 100 μm to have any chance to get to the surface.  


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}


* Typical rain drops are 2000 μm (2 mm) and have a terminal velocity of 8.8 m/s
* To reach this size, must be processes to let droplets grow in clouds

## Collision-Coalescence Process

Larger droplets fall faster than smaller ones and collide and combine with them.  After many collisions, large droplets are big enough to overcome updrafts and survive evaporation on the way down.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

* Need a spectrum of droplet sizes to work – many very small, a few large ones
* Mainly occurs in the tropics

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

## Three-phase Process

Requires a mixture of ice crystals, water droplets, and water vapor co-existing at temperatures below freezing

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

* Depends on the fact that saturation vapor pressure over surface of ice is slightly lower than over liquid water 
  + Small gradient exists, from liquid to ice

## Three-phase process

Saturation vapor pressure is slightly lower around ice crystals than water droplets; ice has tighter bonds than liquid water.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}


* The ice crystals collide and stick and hook together, forming snowflakes and growing large enough to fall

* Most of the rain falling in middle latitudes (even in summer) begins as snow


:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

::: {.notes}

Making snow through deposition. (A) Snowflakes grow when water vapor, evaporated from supercooled cloud droplets, is deposited directly on an ice crystal, causing it to grow. (B) All snowflakes are hexagons, reflecting the six-sided structure of the hydrogen bonds between water molecules (see Figure 1.5).

## Take home points


* Clouds form when an air mass is cools to the dew point and condenses (the Lifting Condensation Level).
* Lifting of an air mass can be due to convection, orography, convergence and /or frontal systems.
* Important cloud types are: cumulus, cirrus and stratus - high ones are made up of ice, low ones of liquid water.
* Precipitation forms when cloud droplets grow - due to collision (warm process) or due to differential saturation vapor pressure of ice and liquid water (three-phase process).
