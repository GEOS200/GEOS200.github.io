## Forms of energy in the atmosphere


* **Radiation**: electromagnetic waves (e.g., sunlight)
* **Sensible heat**: thermal energy we can feel (e.g., warm air, cold ice)
* **Latent heat**: phase changes of a water (e.g., evaporation, condensation)
* **Chemical** energy: bonds of atoms (e.g., photosynthesis)
* **Kinetic**: from motion (e.g., winds)
* **Geopotential**: position in gravitational field


::: {.notes}

This is an important slide and worth  memorizing. Remember “sensible heat” is heat  that can be “sensed” or felt. We can measure  sensible heat with a thermometer. Latent means “hidden” and therefore is associated with the energy used to change phases of water.

## Heat vs. Temperature


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Heat** is the thermal energy 

* Sum of kinetic and potential energy


:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Temperature** a (relative) measure of thermal energy.


* Average random kinetic energy 
  - The ability of a body to transfer thermal energy

::: {.notes}

The difference between HEAT and TEMPERATURE is important and a little subtle. To illustrate this, can you think of a situation where heat is added but temperature does not change?? Perhaps the one you know best is when water reaches boiling point in a pot on the stove - its temperature stays at 100oC but heat continues to be added. Note the K in the slide stands for temperature in Kelvins.

## Heat vs. Temperature

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Heat** is thermal energy 

* Travels from hotter to colder objects
* **Can do work**
* Often expressed in Joules (J)
  - J = 1 N x 1 m
  - Newton (N) = 1 kg m s<sup>-2</sup>

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Temperature** a (relative) measure of thermal energy.

* Increases/decreases when heat is added/removed
* **Cannot do work**

## Temperature scales compared {.smaller}


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}


Several scales have been invented: 

+ Fahrenheit, Celsius, Kelvin...

* According to [the SI system](../Resources.qmd#the-si-system)

  - We should use Kelvin (K)
  - or Celsius (°C) 
    + *For absolute temperatures only*

* Conversion:

Temperature scales have changed over time and really only developed in response to the ability to blow glass tubes (in Italy) in which some kind of thermally responsive liquid could be contained (e.g. mercury, alcohol). We will use the absolute temperature scale (K) a lot in this course. For example a sunny 20 C day in Vancouver would be 293.15 K

The main point here is that because energy is required to change phase we talk about this type of energy use as LATENT HEAT.NOTICE the large amounts of energy associated with Evaporation and Condensation, compared to melting and freezing. In evaporation larges amounts of heat are required and are the reason you feel cold (heat taken from your body) when water evaporates from your body after coming out of a swimming pool. Similarly, when water vapour condenses into a liquid, large amounts of heat are released into the atmosphere. 
This is of course a way for energy to be from the tropics to mid latitudes.

## Energy transfer in the atmosphere


![](images/Lecture1/17_3.png)


::: {.notes}

Here we continue with the definition of basic  physical processes that you are hopefully very familiar with. Examples would be: Radiation: light coming from the sun Conduction: heat transferred from molecule to molecule as you would see in the soil or a rod  that is heated in a campfire Convection: heat transferred by a moving fluid such as in a boiling pot, milk poured into a cup of coffee or cumulus clouds in the atmosphere. 

:::




## Convection

There are free and forced types of convection. 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="35%"}

* Forced convection would be air movement caused by a fan or the wind.

::: {.column width="65%"}


![Free convection of heat from hot ground](images/Lecture1/18_3.png)


:::

::::


::: {.notes}

NOTE: CONVECTION is associated with vertical motion in the atmosphere while ADVECTION refers to horizontal motion. Free convection is when air rises of its own accord because it is warmer and less dense than the surrounding air. Forced convection is when air is forced up and over a barrier such as a hill.

## Heat Flux (iClicker)

Heat always travels from:

- A: Hotter to colder
- B: Colder to hotter
- C: Either A or B



## Fluxes and flux densities 

Generally speaking: flux densities can be positive or negative.


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

## Conservation of energy and mass

One of the most powerful laws used in analyzing organism-environment interaction is this **Law of Conservation**.

* Neither mass nor energy can be created or destroyed by any ordinary means. 
* The application is similar to reconciling your checking account i.e. you can construct a budget or balance to account for all inflows and outflows of heat and mass.

## Summary

* Difference between heat and temperature 
  - Heat does work - temperature does not
* What is latent heat?
  - Energy associated with phase change (of water)
* Flux vs. flux density 
  - Flux density is energy transport per unit area per unit time (W m-2)


## Summary

* Energy and mass transfer mechanisms 
  - Radiation, conduction, and convection
* Understand the concept of energy and mass balances and their connectivity 
  - Neither mass nor energy can be created or destroyed by any ordinary means, just converted from one form to another.
