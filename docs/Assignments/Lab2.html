<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Radiative Properties of Natural Surfaces</h1>
<p>Recall from from <a href="1.qmd#radiation">Lab 1</a>: sets of pyranometers and pyrgeometers, one of each pointing upward toward the sky and downward toward the ground, are used to measure both incoming and outgoing short-wave (<span class="math inline">\(SW\)</span>) and long-wave (<span class="math inline">\(LW\)</span>) radiation respectively. We differentiate <span class="math inline">\(SW\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(LW\)</span> by based on wavelength (<span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>); the distinction is relative and will may see some variability across the literature, but we typically use 3 <span class="math inline">\(\mu m\)</span> as the cutoff <a href="#fig-SWvLW">Figure&nbsp;1</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(SW\)</span> = $&lt; 3 m</li>

</ul>
<section id="net-radiation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="net-radiation">Net Radiation</h2>
<p>These four components together constitute Net All-Wave Radiation (<span class="math inline">\(R_n\)</span>), which is defined the sum of all radiation components <a href="#eq-netRad">Equation&nbsp;1</a>. <span id="eq-netRad"><span class="math display">\[
R_n = (SW \downarrow - SW\uparrow) + (LW\downarrow - LW\uparrow)
\tag{1}\]</span></span></p>
<p>Short-wave (aka solar) radiation is emitted from the sun. Climate of an ecosystem is largely determined by the amount of incoming short wave radiation (<span class="math inline">\(SW \downarrow\)</span>) that reaches the ecosystem and the proportion of that radiation that is absorbed (<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>) by the plant, soil and water surfaces versus the portion that is reflected (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>) by the surface.</p>
<ul>
<li>When <span class="math inline">\(SW \downarrow\)</span> that is absorbed by the earth’s surface, it is re-emitted by the surface as long-wave radiation (<span class="math inline">\(LW \uparrow\)</span>), aka (aka thermal radiation). <a href="#fig-SWvLW">Figure&nbsp;1</a> highlights the difference between short-wave radiation (emitted by the sun) and long-wave radiation (emitted by the earth).</li>
</ul>
<p>A portion of <span class="math inline">\(SW \downarrow\)</span> is reflected by the earths surface back towards the sky, this is known as outgoing, or reflected short-wave radiation (<span class="math inline">\(SW \uparrow\)</span>).</p>
<p>Net Radiation can describe how much energy is entering or leaving a given area. Incoming short-wave <span class="math inline">\((\downarrow SW)\)</span> is measured by a pyranometer pointing up to the sky and short-wave radiation outgoing (reflected) from the underlying surface <span class="math inline">\((\uparrow SW)\)</span> is measured by a pyranometer pointed at the ground. Likewise, incoming long-wave radiation <span class="math inline">\((\downarrow LW)\)</span> is measured by a pyrgeometer pointing up to the sky and outgoing (emitted) long-wave radiation <span class="math inline">\((\uparrow LW)\)</span> is measured by a pyrgeometer pointing at the ground. Knowing the four radiation components, we can then calculate net radiation <span class="math inline">\((R_n)\)</span>. Net radiation can tell us how much energy is entering (positive) or leaving (negative) the site at any given time. If net <span class="math inline">\((R_n)\)</span> is a large positive number, that indicates significant energy input, which would cause the land surface at the site to warm up. Conversely, if <span class="math inline">\((R_n)\)</span> is negative, that means the site is loosing energy (cooling off).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="theory">Theory</h2>
<p>All radiation striking a surface or an object must be either absorbed, transmitted, or reflected:</p>
<p><span id="eq-balance"><span class="math display">\[
a_\lambda + \tau_\lambda + \alpha_\lambda = 1
\tag{2}\]</span></span></p>
<p>The coefficients of absorption (absorptivity <span class="math inline">\(a_\lambda\)</span>), transmission (transmissivity <span class="math inline">\(\tau_\lambda\)</span>), and reflection (reflectivity <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_\lambda\)</span>) are not the same for all kinds of radiation. Their values depend on the wavelength <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> of the incident radiation (e.g., difference between wavelengths from a fluorescent and incandescent lamp). When talking specifically about <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{SW}\)</span> (reflected short wave radiation), we can also define the term albedo, the coefficient of reflection for short wave radiation:</p>
<p><span id="eq-albedo"><span class="math display">\[
albedo = \alpha_{SW} = \frac{\uparrow SW}{\downarrow SW}
\tag{3}\]</span></span></p>
<p>Given the definition for albedo (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{SW}\)</span>), we can also re-define <span class="math inline">\(SW\uparrow = \alpha_{SW} SW\uparrow\)</span> and therefore, rewrite <a href="#eq-netRad">Equation&nbsp;1</a> as:</p>
<p><span id="eq-netRadAlpha"><span class="math display">\[
R_n = (1-\alpha_{SW})SW\downarrow + (LW\downarrow - LW\uparrow)
\tag{4}\]</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> This definition works because the earth’s surface is not a source of short-wave radiation; it can <em>reflect</em> <span class="math inline">\(SW\)</span>, but it does not <em>emit</em> <span class="math inline">\(SW\)</span>.</li>

<p>To describe a radiation source, we can plot its spectrum. Spectra for solar radiation and radiation from a fluorescent lamp and an incandescent tungsten filament lamp are shown in <a href="#fig-spectralOut">Figure&nbsp;2</a>. In this diagram, the spectra have been adjusted to equal peak heights.</p>
<p>Plant leaves have interesting radiative properties that are part of the plants’ adaptation to their environments. The coefficients of reflection, transmission and absorption are strongly dependent on wavelength as shown by a typical example in <a href="#fig-poplar">Figure&nbsp;3</a>. Energy is strongly absorbed in the visible region where radiation is active in photosynthesis. In the near infrared region (NIR) radiation is more strongly reflected and transmitted. The reflectivity and absorptivity of soils and animal coats are also dependent on wavelength.</p>
<p>Units of wavelength are often given in micrometers (1 <span class="math inline">\(\mu m\)</span> = 10-6 m). Radiation energy flux density can be measured by sensors that produce electrical signals. In this laboratory the selenium photocell produces a voltage that is proportional to the flux of shortwave radiation striking the sensor. The sensor is not sensitive to longwave radiation. The selenium photocell has its maximum (peak) response at <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> = 0.5 <span class="math inline">\(\mu m\)</span>.</p>

<li><p>Turn the multimeter to the 300 mV position. Turn on the fluorescent lamp directly above your first soil sample. Hold the switch for at least 3-5 seconds to make sure the lamp switches on properly.</p></li>
<li><p>Measure the amount of short-wave radiation striking one soil surface by placing the photocell horizontally and 0.5 cm above the soil surface. Make sure that the darker (sensitive) side of the sensor is facing upwards. Write down the voltage reading from the meter.</p></li>
<li><p>Turn the photocell over and hold it with the sensitive side downwards horizontally about 2 cm above your soil surface. If the sensor is held too close to the surface, it will “see” too much of its own shadow. Read the voltage from the meter.</p></li>

<p>This exercise is designed to acquaint you with the component fluxes of a radiation budget.</p>
<p>The following simple computations help to demonstrate the radiation relationships existing between the Sun (the Earth’s only source of energy) and the Earth and the Earth and Space.

<p>The all-wave budget can also be considered to consist of a net short-wave budget, <span class="math inline">\(SW* = SW\downarrow - SW\uparrow\)</span> and a long-wave budget <span class="math inline">\(SW* = SW\downarrow - SW\uparrow\)</span> , i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(R_n = SW* + LW*\)</span>. The sign convention adopted here is that individual fluxes have no sign (i.e., always positive) but net fluxes (those with an asterisk) are positive if they are a net energy gain for the surface, and negative if they are a net energy loss.</p>

<p>Q4. Consider a dry soil and semi-arid shrubland landscape (e.g., The Okanagan Desert) at midday where K↓ = 870 W m-2, L↓ = 300 W m-2, 𝛼 = 0.34 and T0 = 38°C (Day 1). Overnight a severe thunderstorm soaks the area. At midday on the following day (Day 2) the incoming radiation terms are identical with the previous day but 𝛼 = 0.17 and T0 = 24°C. Calculate K<em>, L</em>, and Q* at midday for both days and the change in Q* (=ΔQ<em>) between the two occasions (use the Table for B1 and B2 spreadsheet and fill out the table for B1). You may assume the surface to act as a black-body for long-wave radiation. What surface properties explain the differences in Q</em> between sites? Please make sure to show calculations to receive full marks. [4]</p>

<p>Q5. More realistically, assume that the surface in B1 acts as a grey body (fill out table B2). The surface emissivity would increase as a result of increased soil water content from ε = 0.93 (Day 1) to ε = 0.97 (Day 2). Would this augment or diminish the change in Q*? Copy both tables into your lab report, show calculations and explain your reasoning. [4.5]</p>

<p>Q6. The radiation fluxes in Fig. 3.1 are mean daily values for a wetland in Manitoba during March, 2022. Higher albedo in early March is due to the presence of snow, and its subsequent decline is due to snow soiling and melting. Notice that once the snow begins to melt K↓ (or Kdown) and Q* are in-phase (a rise or fall in one is paralleled in the other). However, with fresh snow on the ground (i.e., early March) this relationship is disrupted and even with relatively high solar radiant input the all-wave budget (Q*) is near zero. Attempt an explanation of these features of the budget and any others you may notice. [2]</p>
