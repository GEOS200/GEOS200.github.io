<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="short-wave-long-wave-radiation">Short-wave &amp; Long-wave Radiation</h2>
<p>In meteorology, we broadly classify radiation by wavelength <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> as either short-wave (<span class="math inline">\(SW\)</span>) or long-wave (<span class="math inline">\(LW\)</span>). Units of wavelength are often given in micrometers (1 <span class="math inline">\(\mu m\)</span> = 10<sup>-6</sup> m). The distinction is relative and you may see variability across the literature. We will define them as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Short-wave (<span class="math inline">\(SW\)</span>)</strong>: <span class="math inline">\(\lambda &lt; 3 \mu m\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Long-wave (<span class="math inline">\(LW\)</span>)</strong>: <span class="math inline">\(\lambda &gt;= 3 \mu m\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Recall from lecture<sup><a href="../Slides/Lecture2.html#/radiation-balance">1</a> <a href="../Slides/Lecture3.html#/absorption-in-the-atmosphere">2</a> <a href="../Slides/Lecture4.html#/recall">3</a></sup>: radiation may interact with an object in one of three ways; it can be absorbed, transmitted, or reflected.</p>

<li><p>Plant leaves have interesting radiative properties that are part of the plants’ adaptation to their environments. The coefficients of reflection, transmission and absorption are strongly dependent on wavelength as shown by a typical example in <a href="#fig-poplar">Figure&nbsp;1</a>.</p>

<p>Recall from lecture<sup><a href="http://localhost:6383/Slides/Lecture2.html#/total-emissions">1</a></sup>; the radiative output of an object is proportional to its temperature. The total radiative output can be approximated (for an idealized object) using the Stefan-Boltzman law:</p>

<p>To describe a radiation source, we can plot its spectrum. Spectra for solar radiation and radiation from a fluorescent lamp and an incandescent tungsten filament lamp are shown in <a href="#fig-spectralOut">Figure&nbsp;2</a>.</p>

<li>Because the sun is very hot (<span class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span> 5800 K) it emits a large amount of radiation across a wide range of the wavelengths <a href="#fig-SWvLW">Figure&nbsp;3</a>.

<p>Following equation <a href="#eq-Radiation-Balance">Equation&nbsp;1</a>. A portion of incoming short-wave radiation (<span class="math inline">\(SW \downarrow\)</span>) that hits Earth is reflected by the surface back towards the sky as outgoing short-wave radiation (<span class="math inline">\(SW \uparrow\)</span>). We can define the term <strong>albedo</strong> to describe reflected short wave radiation (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha_SW\)</span>):</p>
<p><span id="eq-Albedo"><span class="math display">\[
albedo = \alpha_{SW} = \frac{\uparrow SW}{\downarrow SW}
\tag{3}\]</span></span></p>
<p>Following <a href="#eq-Radiation-Balance">Equation&nbsp;1</a>, the earth can also absorb shortwave radiation (<span class="math inline">\(a_{SW}\)</span>). The earth (as a whole) also does not transmit short-wave radiation (<span class="math inline">\(\tau_{SW}\)</span>). However objects on or near its surface, such as leaves can <a href="#fig-poplar">Figure&nbsp;1</a>. When dealing with an opaque object such as a the surface of the earth, we can define absorption as <a href="#eq-Absorption-Opaque">Equation&nbsp;4</a>, but when dealing with transparent objects such as leaves or water, we must define absorption as <a href="#eq-Absorption-Transparent">Equation&nbsp;5</a>:</p>
<p><span id="eq-Absorption-Opaque"><span class="math display">\[
a_{\lambda} = 1  - \alpha_{\lambda}
\tag{4}\]</span></span></p>
<p><span id="eq-Absorption-Transparent"><span class="math display">\[
a_{\lambda} = 1  - \alpha_{\lambda} - \tau_{\lambda}
\tag{5}\]</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Note <a href="#eq-Radiation-Balance">Equation&nbsp;1</a> and <a href="#eq-Absorption-Transparent">Equation&nbsp;5</a> are equivalent to one another.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following <a href="#eq-Absorption-Opaque">Equation&nbsp;4</a>, any short-wave radiation that is not reelected by the Earth’s surface, will be absorbed. When short-wave radiation is absorbed, the energy is “transformed” from one form to another. Some of the energy goes towards phase changes of water, some of it goes into chemical reactions (e.g., photosynthesis), and a large portion of it is re-emitted as outgoing long-wave radiation (<span class="math inline">\(LW\uparrow\)</span>), aka. thermal radiation. Following</p>
<p>Combining these Net All-Wave Radiation (<span class="math inline">\(R_n\)</span>), as defined in <a href="#eq-Net-Radiation">Equation&nbsp;6</a>, is the sum of all incoming (<span class="math inline">\(\downarrow\)</span>) and outgoing (<span class="math inline">\(\uparrow\)</span>) short-wave (<span class="math inline">\(SW\)</span>) and long-wave (<span class="math inline">\(LW\)</span>) radiation. Net radiation can tell us how much energy is entering (positive) or leaving (negative) the site at any given time. If net <span class="math inline">\((R_n)\)</span> is a large positive number, that indicates significant energy input, which would cause the land surface at the site to warm up. Conversely, if <span class="math inline">\((R_n)\)</span> is negative, that means the site is loosing energy (cooling off).</p>
<p><span id="eq-Net-Radiation"><span class="math display">\[
R_n = (SW \downarrow - SW \uparrow) + (LW \downarrow - LW \uparrow)
\tag{6}\]</span></span></p>
<p>The all-wave budget could also be considered to consist of a net short-wave budget, <span class="math inline">\(SW* = SW\downarrow - SW\uparrow\)</span> and a long-wave budget <span class="math inline">\(SW* = SW\downarrow - SW\uparrow\)</span> , i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(R_n = SW* + LW*\)</span>. The sign convention adopted here is that individual fluxes have no sign (i.e., always positive) but net fluxes (those with an asterisk) are positive if they are a net energy gain for the surface, and negative if they are a net energy loss.</p>

<p>The following simple computations help to demonstrate the radiation relationships existing between the Sun (the Earth’s only source of energy) and the Earth and the Earth and Space. They explain the sizes of the radiation streams between these bodies and so doing illustrate the concept of a radiation budget.</p>
<p><strong>RECALL:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Flux</strong> = Energy flow, Watts or W [i.e., Joules per second]</p>
<p><strong>Flux Density</strong> = Energy flow divided by area (W m<sup>-2</sup>).</p>

<p>Extending the logic applied above, you can also use this approach to approximate the radiative flux density at the top of the Earth’s atmosphere. Simply substitute the mean radius of the Earth’s orbit (1.5 × 10<sup>11</sup> m) for the radius of the sun in your above calculation.</p>

<p>Radiation energy flux density can be measured by sensors that produce electrical signals. In this laboratory you will measure radiation with a <strong>multimeter</strong>. The multimeter has as selenium photocell which produces a voltage that is proportional to the flux of short-wave radiation striking the sensor. The sensor is not sensitive to long-wave radiation. The selenium photocell has its maximum (peak) response at <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> = 0.5 <span class="math inline">\(\mu m\)</span>.</p>
<p>You will conduct a brief experiment to measure how short-wave radiation interacts with various surfaces. You can keep track of your results in <a href="www/ExperimentalObservationsTable.xlsx">this excel file</a>. You can also us the file to calculate the components of <a href="#eq-Radiation-Balance">Equation&nbsp;1</a>. If you aren’t sure how to set up calculations in excel, you TA can offer assistance.</p>
<p>You will use the multimeter to measure shortwave irradiance under two light sources: fluorescent and incandescent lamps. You will also measure reflectivity (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{\lambda}\)</span>) and transmissivity (<span class="math inline">\(\tau{\lambda}\)</span>) where applicable. From these measurements, you can then calculate the absorptivity (<span class="math inline">\(a_{\lambda}\)</span>)</p>

<ol class="example" type="1">
<li><p>Turn the multimeter to the 300 mV position. Turn on the fluorescent lamp directly above your first soil sample. Hold the switch for at least 3-5 seconds to make sure the lamp switches on properly.</p></li>
<li><p>Measure the amount of short-wave radiation striking one soil surface by placing the photocell horizontally and 0.5 cm above the soil surface. Make sure that the darker (sensitive) side of the sensor is facing upwards. Write down the voltage reading from the meter.</p></li>
<li><p>Turn the photocell over and hold it with the sensitive side downwards horizontally about 2 cm above your soil surface. If the sensor is held too close to the surface, it will “see” too much of its own shadow. Read the voltage from the meter.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the coefficient of reflection <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{\lambda}\)</span> for the fluorescent lamp-soil combination:</p></li>
<li><p>Exchange the fluorescent lamp for the incandescent lamp. It is suggested to keep room lights switched off during measurements involving incandescent lamps. Why? Measure the coefficient of reflection <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{\lambda}\)</span> for the incandescent lamp-soil combination:</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat this procedure for all soil samples under both light sources. Calculate coefficients of reflection <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{SW}\)</span> as well as absorption <span class="math inline">\(a_{SW}\)</span> for all samples. Note, here: <span class="math inline">\(\tau_{\lambda} = 0\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Measure incident, reflected and transmitted light of a green leaf - separately for both light sources. In addition to the measurements above, without moving the leaf, place the radiation sensor under the leaf with the negative side upwards. Calculate the coefficients of transmission by:</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat the procedure for a yellow or brown autumnal leaf. Calculate the coefficients of reflection <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{SW}\)</span> , transmission <span class="math inline">\(\tau_{\lambda} = 0\)</span> and absorption <span class="math inline">\(a_{SW}\)</span> for the fluorescent and incandescent radiation on the leaf.</p></li>

<p><a href="#fig-AlbedoDiff">Figure&nbsp;4</a> shows photos from the Burns Bog Station in two days in late December 2022. <a href="#fig-Radiation">Figure&nbsp;5</a> shows the four radiation components that were measured at the site during this period. Using the data in the <a href="#fig-Radiation">Figure&nbsp;5</a> calculate albedo for timestamps that most closely correspond to the time of the images in <a href="#fig-AlbedoDiff">Figure&nbsp;4</a>. How do these to values compare to one another? What explains any differences?</p>
