<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="short-wave-vs.-long-wave-radiation">Short-wave vs.&nbsp;Long-wave Radiation</h2>
<p>In meteorology, we broadly classify radiation by wavelength <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> as either short-wave (<span class="math inline">\(SW\)</span>) or long-wave (<span class="math inline">\(LW\)</span>). Units of wavelength are often given in micrometers (1 <span class="math inline">\(\mu m\)</span> = 10<sup>-6</sup> m). The distinction is relative and you may see variability across the literature. We will define them as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Short-wave (<span class="math inline">\(SW\)</span>)</strong>: <span class="math inline">\(\lambda &lt; 3 \mu m\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Long-wave (<span class="math inline">\(LW\)</span>)</strong>: <span class="math inline">\(\lambda &gt;= 3 \mu m\)</span></li>

<li><p>Plant leaves have interesting radiative properties that are part of the plants’ adaptation to their environments. The coefficients of reflection, transmission and absorption are strongly dependent on wavelength as shown by a typical example in <a href="#fig-poplar">Figure&nbsp;1</a>.</p>

<p>Recall from lecture<sup><a href="../Slides/Lecture2.html#/total-emissions">1</a></sup>; the radiative output of an object is proportional to its temperature. The radiative flux density can be approximated (for an idealized object) using the Stefan-Boltzman Law for a “Black Body”:</p>
<p><span id="eq-Stefan-Boltzman-Law"><span class="math display">\[
E_b = \sigma_b T^4
\tag{2}\]</span></span></p>
<p>However, in reality, we must adjust the calculation to account for the emissivity coefficient (<span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>) of the object. The <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> value represents the actual radiative output of a real object relative to the emission of an idealized Black-body at the same temperature. To do to this we can adjust and use the Stefan-Boltzman Law for a “Grey Body”:</p>
<p><span id="eq-Stefan-Boltzman-Law-Grey-Body"><span class="math display">\[
E_g = \epsilon\sigma_b T^4
\tag{3}\]</span></span></p>
<div class="columns">
<div class="column" style="width:50%;">
<p>To describe a radiation source, we can plot its spectrum. Spectra for solar radiation and radiation from a fluorescent lamp and an incandescent tungsten filament lamp are shown in <a href="#fig-spectralOut">Figure&nbsp;2</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because the sun is very hot (<span class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span> 5800 K) it emits a large amount of radiation across a wide range of the wavelengths <a href="#fig-SWvLW">Figure&nbsp;3</a>.
<ul>
<li>It is important to note that: short-wave radiation makes up the overwhelming majority (99+%) of the sun’s radiative output<br>

<p>Thankfully, on Earth, we are not subject to the full radiative output of the sun. The solar beam spreads out (dissipates) on the (approximately) 150 million km journey from the sun to the Earth. Satellite measurements indicate that the mean radiative flux density a the top of the atmosphere is 1361 W m<sup>-2</sup>; this value is known as the solar constant <span class="math inline">\(I_0\)</span>. Knowing the value of the solar constant, we can do some calculations to deduce the total radiative flux of the sun in W. The calculation is shown in the example below in <a href="#exm-Solar-Flux">Example&nbsp;1</a> using R code. See the output at the bottom for the approximate value. <strong>Note:</strong> This is just an illustrative example to expose you to programmatic calculations using <a href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html">R</a>. You do not need to know/learn R for this course.</p>
<p>The earth has a slightly eccentric orbit - it is elliptical (slightly oval shaped) and off center. This means that the distance between the earth and the sun vary slightly. The Earth is closest to the sun (147 million km) on the <strong>perihelion</strong> which occurs in early January and it is farthest from the sun (152 million km) on the <strong>aphelion</strong> in early July <a href="#fig-Sun-Earth">Figure&nbsp;4 (a)</a>. Consequently, the true flux density of the solar beam at the top of Earth’s atmosphere will deviate slightly from the solar constant over the course of the year.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="balancing-the-budget">Balancing the Budget</h2>
<p>Following equation <a href="#eq-Radiation-Balance">Equation&nbsp;1</a>. A portion of incoming short-wave radiation (<span class="math inline">\(SW \downarrow\)</span>) that hits Earth is reflected by the surface back towards the sky as outgoing short-wave radiation (<span class="math inline">\(SW \uparrow\)</span>). We can define the term <strong>albedo</strong> to describe reflected short wave radiation (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha_SW\)</span>):</p>
<p><span id="eq-Albedo"><span class="math display">\[
albedo = \alpha_{SW} = \frac{\uparrow SW}{\downarrow SW}
\tag{4}\]</span></span></p>
<p>Following <a href="#eq-Radiation-Balance">Equation&nbsp;1</a>, the earth can also absorb shortwave radiation (<span class="math inline">\(a_{SW}\)</span>). The earth (as a whole) also does not transmit short-wave radiation (<span class="math inline">\(\tau_{SW}\)</span>). However objects on or near its surface, such as leaves can <a href="#fig-poplar">Figure&nbsp;1</a>. When dealing with an opaque object such as a the surface of the earth, we can define absorption as <a href="#eq-Absorption-Opaque">Equation&nbsp;5</a>, but when dealing with transparent objects such as leaves or water, we must define absorption as <a href="#eq-Absorption-Transparent">Equation&nbsp;6</a>:</p>
<p><span id="eq-Absorption-Opaque"><span class="math display">\[
a_{\lambda} = 1  - \alpha_{\lambda}
\tag{5}\]</span></span></p>
<p><span id="eq-Absorption-Transparent"><span class="math display">\[
a_{\lambda} = 1  - \alpha_{\lambda} - \tau_{\lambda}
\tag{6}\]</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Note <a href="#eq-Radiation-Balance">Equation&nbsp;1</a> and <a href="#eq-Absorption-Transparent">Equation&nbsp;6</a> are equivalent to one another.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following <a href="#eq-Absorption-Opaque">Equation&nbsp;5</a>, any short-wave radiation that is not reelected by the Earth’s surface, will be absorbed. When short-wave radiation is absorbed, the energy is “transformed” from one form to another. Some of the energy goes towards phase changes of water, some of it goes into chemical reactions (e.g., photosynthesis), and a large portion of it is re-emitted as outgoing long-wave radiation (<span class="math inline">\(LW\uparrow\)</span>), aka. thermal radiation. Following</p>
<p>Combining these Net All-Wave Radiation (<span class="math inline">\(R_n\)</span>), as defined in <a href="#eq-Net-Radiation">Equation&nbsp;7</a>, is the sum of all incoming (<span class="math inline">\(\downarrow\)</span>) and outgoing (<span class="math inline">\(\uparrow\)</span>) short-wave (<span class="math inline">\(SW\)</span>) and long-wave (<span class="math inline">\(LW\)</span>) radiation. Net radiation can tell us how much energy is entering (positive) or leaving (negative) the site at any given time. If net <span class="math inline">\((R_n)\)</span> is a large positive number, that indicates significant energy input, which would cause the land surface at the site to warm up. Conversely, if <span class="math inline">\((R_n)\)</span> is negative, that means the site is loosing energy (cooling off).</p>
<p><span id="eq-Net-Radiation"><span class="math display">\[
R_n = (SW \downarrow - SW \uparrow) + (LW \downarrow - LW \uparrow)
\tag{7}\]</span></span></p>
<p>The all-wave budget could also be considered to consist of a net short-wave budget, <span class="math inline">\(SW* = SW\downarrow - SW\uparrow\)</span> and a long-wave budget <span class="math inline">\(SW* = SW\downarrow - SW\uparrow\)</span> , i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(R_n = SW* + LW*\)</span>. The sign convention adopted here is that individual fluxes have no sign (i.e., always positive) but net fluxes (those with an asterisk) are positive if they are a net energy gain for the surface, and negative if they are a net energy loss.</p>

<p>Radiation energy flux density can be measured by sensors that produce electrical signals. In this laboratory you will measure radiation with a <strong>multimeter</strong>. The multimeter has as selenium photocell which produces a voltage that is proportional to the flux of short-wave radiation striking the sensor. The sensor is not sensitive to long-wave radiation. The selenium photocell has its maximum (peak) response at <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> = 0.5 <span class="math inline">\(\mu m\)</span>.</p>
<p>You will conduct a brief experiment to measure how short-wave radiation interacts with various surfaces. You can keep track of your results in <a href="www/ExperimentalObservationsTable.xlsx">this excel file</a>. You can also us the file to calculate the components of <a href="#eq-Radiation-Balance">Equation&nbsp;1</a>. If you aren’t sure how to set up calculations in excel, you TA can offer assistance.</p>
<p>You will use the multimeter to measure shortwave irradiance under two light sources: fluorescent and incandescent lamps. You will also measure reflectivity (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{\lambda}\)</span>) and transmissivity (<span class="math inline">\(\tau{\lambda}\)</span>) where applicable. From these measurements, you can then calculate the absorptivity (<span class="math inline">\(a_{\lambda}\)</span>)</p>

<li><p>Turn the photocell over and hold it with the sensitive side downwards horizontally about 2 cm above your soil surface. If the sensor is held too close to the surface, it will “see” too much of its own shadow. Read the voltage from the meter.</p></li>

<p>The Burns Bog Station station is a at latitude of 49.5 <span class="math inline">\(^{\circ}\)</span> and the solar declination on the winter solstice (December 21<sup>st</sup>) is -23.5 <span class="math inline">\(^{\circ}\)</span>. The solar constant (<span class="math inline">\(I_0\)</span>) is approximately 1361 W m<sup>-2</sup>. Given this information, the R code shown below <a href="#exm-Cosine-Law">Example&nbsp;2</a> is using the <a href="../Slides/Lecture3.html#/cosine-law-of-illumination">cosine law of illumination</a> to estimate the effect of beam spreading on incoming solar radiation at the on the winter solstice. Why does the value estimated calculated below not match what was observed at the Burns Bog Site at solar noon on December 21st 2022? Look <a href="#fig-AlbedoSnow">Figure&nbsp;5 (b)</a>, carefully inspect the <span class="math inline">\(SW\downarrow\)</span> for that day shown in <a href="#fig-Radiation">Figure&nbsp;6</a>, and reference the <a href="../Slides/Lecture4.html#/diurnal-variation">lecture materials</a> for help answering this question.</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Reflection of the solar beam due to cloud cover</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Attenuation of the solar beam due to Rayleigh scattering in the atmosphere</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> Attenuation of the solar beam due to absorption by Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) in the upper atmosphere</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> Reflection of the solar beam due to snow cover on the ground</p>
